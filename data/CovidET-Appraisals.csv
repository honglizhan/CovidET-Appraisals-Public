He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live.

I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it.

Im thinking about stopping eating so I can afford therapy. Theres no point to any of this. Every death that is about to happen here could have been prevented, and no one cares and they call me crazy.

Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

I have an appointment booked for my second dose of Pfizer on Monday, with the possibility of moving it up to tomorrow. I struggle with severe food allergies and therefore getting the first dose of the vaccine was incredibly difficult for me. I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose? Second, I am a woman in my early twenties. Ive heard reports of myocarditis after the second dose in young people. This is quite scary to me as Im very active. Should I be concerned?

375VSR8FW5K1SEA2U8NIFVRJSW9ZRO,39PAAFCODWBZMTGEN28BJOALHN6VTP,AM6H40LNWSFYA,og9qaf,"Hi everyone - thank you for the support shown in this forum. Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.",4,"The narrator believes they are somewhat responsible for the situation, as they blame themself for bringing down the mood and being too negative.

Ive been invited to a friends surprise hen-do in 1 month. Their maid of honour has rented a whole house for 3 days in a place 4 hours away. This would mean staying with approximately 12 other people, most who I dont know, not to mention sharing a bed and room etc. They have also planned lots of activities like paintball, laser tag, cocktail classes and dinners. Im feeling super anxious about the whole thing: 1. Because of Covid. I currently work in ICU, I caught Covid last year and had a real rough time recovering, and Ive barely gone out much except with close family. I am double vaccinated so that at least helps. At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go. I honestly dont know what to do, I know if I say I will go Im going to have so much anxiety all month leading up to it. I have to reply to the invite in the next few days.

My arm still hurts and has a burning and tingling sensation and Im having headaches everyday since the shot. Today I woke up feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded. I also had chest tightness and went to the hospital where they took my blood and did an ECG and they told me that everything was fine, but the dizziness and the headaches kills me.

Now that things are the way they are in the US, I've been trying to make an effort to see each of my friends at least once this summer, especially as I'll be moving across the country at the end of August. But these days, I've been finding myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. As in... after I get home, I spend the rest of the day slowly building up the energy to even do minor errands around the house (but most of the time I just sink into the couch and stare at the TV for the rest of the day). I've also been purposely scheduling only one hangout every 3-4 days as my energy levels are only really better after that many days. Is this completely out of the ordinary? Pre-pandemic, I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. I feel so wrung out and tired after these hangouts, that I'm not even sure I've had fun by the end of them... I've tried to leave early a couple times too, but maybe my hints aren't strong enough, because I find that my friends don't say goodbye until I really emphasize that I have something to do at home. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired. I want to just say no to 90% of these hangouts but I also feel guilty since I'm leaving and basically set hard limits on in-person hangouts prior to being vaccinated. &amp;#x200B; I don't even know what the purpose of this post is... but I just spent the last 6 hours recovering from a 3 hour hang out.

I've definitely been put through the ringer in the past year and a half - I lost my job which meant my right to live in the UK hung in the balance for a few months, and obviously didn't see any family or friends back home in the US. As of mid-June, I've been fully vaccinated so I flew back to the US to spend time with family during the month of July. I am really happy to see everyone I love, but I'm also experience immense anxiety. I think the thought of going back to normal, when it ISN'T normal and covid is still a threat, is causing me to spiral. It doesn't feel real to be back home, for one. Sometimes, it feels like I'm dissociating because somewhere that's so familiar feels foreign. I feel anxious and guilty about travelling with the variants circulating, and going out (despite the fact I avoid crowded areas and still wear masks indoors). It's setting off other anxieties as well, like intrusive thoughts of suddenly dying or dying early. There's no real point of this post I guess, I just wanted to say it and see if anyone felt similarly. I just had a breakdown and I'm so tired of feeling this way.

Before I get into everything, I want to thank you for taking the time for reading this. When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal. On the other hand, I would feel guilty if I got Covid and gave it to my unvaccinated brother. I am still weighing the pros and cons because I am healthy teenager but I know the Delta Variant is the most dangerous strains yet.

Also wanted to protect people and being younger, I had a fear of spreading it to older people. Second semester of college, I actually moved on campus where I met a lot of friends and had fun. But I always wore my mask, hung out with a few friends who also always protected themselves, and never went to parties despite most of the student body going to these parties every week. School starts next month and things are pretty much back to normal. No masks required. Full stadiums. Sorority events in-person. All of it which Im super excited about. As the first person to go to college in my family, this was the college life I was so excited to live. Especially since college is such a short time experience and Im already 25% through with it.

So I have a fear of school shutting down later this fall and having another year ruined due to the variant and things just going in the wrong direction just like what happened to my senior year.

With restrictions lifted, it makes the world seem a lot scarier for me to bring my child out there. He hasn't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so we have only been to essential dr appointments. Lately, even things like having maintenance or contractors come into my apartment to fix long standing overdue issues seems too hard and I'm avoiding it because my child is unvaccinated and they technically don't have to wear masks inside my apartment I guess. How are those of you with kids navigating all of this? We haven't gotten take out or been in a store this entire time and I know I need to somehow ease back into life and existence because maintaining this level of isolation is really starting to damage my mental health to the point where I don't even know how to interact in the world anymore. We drove past a busy ice cream place a few nights ago and instead of thinking about stopping and enjoying life - I cried. Seeing everyone without masks, close together, kids everywhere - and knowing my little kid isn't protected is so hard.

I have to admit that I was initially shocked... until I looked again at the stats. From what it looks like Los Angeles has not yet completed its round of vaccinations. There are still Latinos and others who have yet to receive the shot. L.A. isn't where it needs to be just yet. So of course the restrictions are coming back. That said, does this mean the same thing will happen everywhere in the United States? No. There are other regions that are highly vaccinated where such mandates will probably not be necessary. Aside from Los Angeles, where else in California have masks been mandated? That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask. Highland Park in NJ is one such place. NJ is also one of the highly vaccinated states, so it's not facing much danger. Once again, this is just UNVACCINATED people. Does it mean these restrictions are going to be forever and that we'll never get our lives back? Does it mean we'll have to live like this forever? No and no. And a thousand times no. Fact: the children's vaccine is coming for September. Remember? THAT is another pocket of unvaccinated people who need to take the shot. Only then can we start to make anymore dents. That said, if you live in Los Angeles County, I understand how you feel. It IS heartbreaking, and it's unfortunate it's come down to this. But simultaneously, it's just a reminder that more people have to be vaccinated over there. And I'm sorry you have to go through this. But once again, we will NOT have to do this forever.

So my sister doesn't really believe in Covid and thinks it's all a part of a bigger agenda. Let me point out that she does believe it exists but just doesn't 'believe' it is as bad as it is, this is all due to her ex-boyfriend who is an total anti-vaxxer and just an as\*hole in general (but that's just IMO). My mother also questions covid a lot, she does 'believe' it exists as well, she's not entirely against all the measurements (apart from a few obvious ridiculous ones we have to deal with here in Southern Spain) however my sister convinced her to also not take the vaccine (my mother is 63). On another side note, my father does 'believe' it all and even got his 2nd second as of 2 weeks ago. I'm literally in between as I dont know what to do with them or how to approach them regarding vaccination as I think it IS necessary and I would like to get my vaccine (I haven't been called yet), have any of you experienced something similar?

Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it.

My mom needs help dealing with my dad's stuff, and I want to pick out some mementos of my favorite parent. I think I was wrong.

She brought Covid home after attending a ""mandatory work Christmas breakfast party"". My dad was definitely vulnerable to the disease, having a history of heart problems. I'm still very very upset and pissed at her. She's a narcissist that's been playing the ""grieving widow"" card since before my dad died.

3OID399FYPI1MN0XBVYR7EUX14BDFN,3WZ36BJEVDRKDFI8ILHBICGEEXOTBJ,AM6H40LNWSFYA,omkfux,"I spent pretty much all of 2020 freaked out over the virus to the point of chaos. I thought that I would get some peace when I got the vaccine (as did all the people I generally come in contact with at any great length) and could stop worrying so much. But then they start talking about breakthrough infections or people who are immuno-suppressed not as protected. Not sure where that leaves me as I have no spleen. I do get plenty of white blood cells when I have some issue, but don't know if that is the same as a broken immune system as it relates to COVID. No one seems to have a straight answer, although I do know there are studies working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated as well, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town that apparently doesn't have any mask requirements. They didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She is excited for the job, but I'm worried that she'll pick up the delta variant as now they say that even casual encounters can get someone infected. And I'm worried that she'll bring home the virus and I'll be compromised, even though I hope neither of us would wind up sick enough to be hospitalized or die. Not to mention going to Walmart was like a nightmare this morning. I was wearing a mask, but it seemed like I was one of the few. Our county is only 27% vaccinated and yet 90% of the people there had no masks because since they lifted the mask requirements, everybody's honor seems to have gone awry. I almost had a panic attack when a guy without a mask coughed near me and the guy got too close. I hate having to be scared of the idea that someone's breath could be like a bullet to the brain, only more agonizing.

Got my first shot, my next one is a little over a week away. After that I have just enough time to let it kick in (to be honest, a couple days short, I messed up my flights a bit) before I fly out again. My luck has been horrific for this whole pandemic though, and of course I can't count on anything going well, so I'm unsurprised that I have managed to crack an entire molar and I need to get it looked at urgently. In spite of being pretty good about my dental hygiene in the past, I've put off my annual dentist check ups for two years because of this shitty pandemic. I kind of have to do something about this, but I'm scared. Rationally I know I have some protection nearly two weeks out from my first jab, and there's a strong chance that the dentists I see here would all have been vaccinated ages ago. I guess I could try to push it off even longer, but when I return to my home country, I'm going to a place where there are way less vaccinations that have been distributed, so I think I'd be more nervous. My luck isn't great and this year has been super hard, I just don't want it to get worse if I can help it at all. Most other doctors visits wouldn't be as scary because I could mask up accordingly... but this is mentally tricky, it's the one thing where I suddenly have to have my mouth wide open around a bunch of strangers for an unknown procedure. My partner is encouraging me to just go now, even though I'm waiting for my second shot, because it's really not great to have this. So, I'm bracing myself, because I think my partner is correct, but my anxiety is firing on all cylinders. Does anyone have some reassurance around going and getting dental work done?

My other friend and I who I live with immediately started isolating, informed my work and they told me to keep coming in. Around Wednesday friend started showing symptoms, we both got tests Thursday and results yesterday. He was positive I was negative so he went into isolation in his room. This morning I woke up with aches and took my temp and it was higher than normal 100.9. Not too bad but am fairly certain it means I have covid. They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough qnd headaches and congestion but energy is fine. I turn 30 in 2 days, the whole thing just sucks. If it's rare how did we all get it?

According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy.

This obviously blew up in their face and there was no one to work for 2 months. There was never even any formal acknowledgement let alone apology for this incredible lapse in judgement. And Steve doesn't believe there was ever any sort of investigation into the event, if that's a thing. Since then there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected. Well apparently it's happening AGAIN, and the only reason any employees are aware are from sharing info with each other. Admin makes no effort to reach out to those working in proximity to others who may be sick, and are giving no explanation for why certain employees are mysteriously gone, not even to managers of said employees. It's complete lunacy, and Steve has no idea what to do. He fears inaction, if not retaliation if talking directly to management. Is there some organization that he can report this to?

I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux &amp; asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up. They usually went away in a day or two. The thought of going to the wrestling show was still in the back of my mind though. By Monday night I had a cough and congested sinuses. So finally this morning I got up and did a rapid test and sure enough it came back positive. Told everyone I went to the show with and everyone I'd seen since (including my parents ugh) and all got tested today or are getting tested tomorrow. Most from today have come back negative thankfully. So now im just sitting here with a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose and sinus headache crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse and that I didn't end up infecting my parents.

3Q7TKIAPP2LNMFATX61P2RZHY3FLDO,3X1FV8S5J72VHOU83294K5VWRV4VGQ,AM6H40LNWSFYA,ophz0r,"An argument I often hear with regards to our path towards herd immunity is that there could be natural immunity on top of vaccinations. And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5.

Im a young, healthy individual who realistically wouldnt suffer extreme effects from COVID.

I havent eaten at a restaurant, havent seen friends, wear a mask wherever I go, still treat mail as though it can contain virus (even though theres research to show its unlikely to catch COVID from touching a surface). I know that even if I did get COVID, it would be mild since Im vaccinated. Still, I cant help but continue to be anxious, especially with the probably third wave were entering in the US. I feel like on one hand I should loosen up - see vaccinated friends/family, for example - and accept the risk of getting sick with a mild illness. But the other part of me feels like I just dont want to ever get COVID, period.

Just a background: I'm NOT an anti-vaxxer but these are the circumstances that force me to ask myself this question. I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused.

It certainly is a lot weaker in many countries, but not here. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread while watching the ceremony.

I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac.
