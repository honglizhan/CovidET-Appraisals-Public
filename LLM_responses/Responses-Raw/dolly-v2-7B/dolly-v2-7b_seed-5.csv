I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.

The situation is somewhat consistent with the external and social norms. The narrator is experiencing muscle aches and pains, and is seeing news reports about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines causing heart problems. This is consistent with what the larger community defines as ""bad"" or ""dangerous"" behavior, so the narrator should be concerned. However, the situation is not completely consistent with the external and social norms, because cutting a line is generally not frowned upon.

The narrator mentions that they are fully vaxed and has been itching to go out again, but is still wary. This suggests that the narrator is a person who is very concerned about getting infected with a virus, and is therefore likely to avoid going out even if there are no restrictions on restaurants. This is consistent with the narrator being a person who values health and safety over leisure.

However, the text does not mention whether the narrator is a vegan or not. If the narrator is a vegan, then it is possible that the narrator's desire to go out and enjoy the company of others is motivated by a desire to support the well-being of animals by eating meat, and therefore the narrator's desire to go out may not be consistent with their values. In this case, the narrator may be better off staying home and enjoying the company of their pets.

I also think it's important to note that this decision was not made by one person. The WHO is a collective body, and the decision was made by the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He is a well-respected medical doctor, and a leading figure in the global response to COVID-19. He is not a politician, and he is not swayed by public opinion. He is a doctor, and he is acting in the best interests of public health.

The delta variant is a more aggressive form of the virus that causes the common cold. Moderna developed a vaccine for the delta variant, and Pfizer and Astra are working on similar vaccines. The delta variant is more aggressive than the common cold virus, and some people find that they can cope better with the common cold because of this.

However, the delta variant can also cause more severe symptoms in people with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or people with HIV/AIDS. The delta variant can also cause more severe symptoms in people with certain types of cancer, such as leukemia. The delta variant can also cause more severe symptoms in people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or asthma.

Because of these factors, some people find that they can cope better with the common cold because of the delta variant.

### End","7/9

The delta variant is a more aggressive form of the virus that causes the common cold. The moderna vaccine is designed to protect against both the common cold and the more aggressive and more severe delta variant. The delta variant is not yet well understood, and there is not yet a consensus on whether the moderna vaccine provides any benefit against it.

The narrator is concerned that people are getting the impression that the moderna vaccine provides any benefit against the delta variant, when in fact there is not yet a consensus on whether it does. The narrator is concerned that this could lead to people not getting the moderna vaccine, which would put their own safety and the safety of their family at risk.

### End","I am concerned that people are getting the impression that the moderna vaccine provides any benefit against the delta variant, when in fact there is not yet a consensus on whether it does.

### End","I'm not sure if I expected the delta variant to be a topic of conversation, but I would say the situation was somewhat expected. Pfizer and Astra have both developed vaccines against the common cold, and Moderna is a new entrant into the market. I don't have any reservations about Moderna's effectiveness, as they have already produced a vaccine for the common cold, and I've personally seen their commercials on TV.

I believe that the level of challenge in a situation can be determined by the individual's perception of their capabilities. If the individual perceives that they have the capabilities to handle a situation, then the level of challenge in the situation may not be perceived as challenging at all.

For example, a situation may be perceived as challenging if the individual does not have the required knowledge or skills to handle the situation. In this case, the individual may perceive the situation as challenging because they do not have the required knowledge or skills to handle the situation.

In contrast, if the individual perceives that they have the required knowledge and skills to handle a situation, then the level of challenge in the situation may be perceived as high.

From what I gather, the narrator is experiencing nausea and vertigo as a result of taking a painkiller for another condition. The painkiller in question is Tylenol, which is an anti-inflammatory and a mild painkiller. The narrator is also taking the Moderna vaccine, which is a new, experimental vaccine that is believed to cause side effects similar to the painkiller. 
From this description, it sounds like the painkiller is causing the nausea and vertigo, and the Moderna vaccine is causing the narrator to experience more severe symptoms. 
From what I gather, the situation is not completely fair. The painkiller is not solely responsible for causing the nausea and vertigo, and the Moderna vaccine is not solely responsible for causing more severe symptoms. Both the painkiller and the Moderna vaccine are contributing factors, and the responsibility for the severity of the symptoms lies with the narrator.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic","I don't think I'm responsible for causing the pandemic. I think it's more likely that the pandemic caused us to realize how dependent we are on technology, and how little we actually know about our own health.

They trigger off my migraines, I could hardly concentrate at school because of it. I also have a sensory disability, which makes wearing masks 10 times harder. Everything is brighter, louder, and everything feels more crowded when I wear them. Its horrible. And it looks like we have to wear them for the next school year, and its my final year. I cant risk it. So I want to know if any you know where I can get masks that are migraine/sensory friendly? While still doing the job a normal medical mask does. Thanks.

### End","Because of the current climate of COVID-19 and the potential for community spread, the L.A. County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) is advising all Angelenos to wear masks in public, including inside of homes. The mask guidelines are as follows:
- Wear a cloth mask if you can easily obtain one
- Wear a medical mask if you cannot easily obtain a cloth mask or do not want to wear a cloth mask
- Wear a N95 mask if you work in a health-care setting that is considered high-risk for COVID-19 exposure
- Wear a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) if you work in a high-risk setting for COVID-19 exposure and have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or shortness of breath

The CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks in public settings where social distancing is difficult, such as inside of homes. However, the CDC also states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of cloth masks outside of medical settings.

The CDC also recommends that people who are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19, such as older adults or people with underlying health conditions, wear a N95 mask or P","NA

I don't know if I'm protected from the virus, and if I am, how well I'm protected. I also don't know if I should be masking up indoors or not. I think this is challenging because it's unclear, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

I'm not sure if I can answer your question fully, but I will share my experience with getting my son vaccinated. My son is 15 months old and we are in the process of getting him vaccinated. I have read many articles and watched many videos online to make an informed decision. I will share my experience with you.

First, I want to share my son's medical history. He has had a few ER visits and a few hospitalizations for various reasons. He has had a few bouts with RSV, which is a common cold virus that can cause pneumonia in very young children and people with asthma or other lung conditions. He also had a bout with PIV, or parainfluenza, which is a virus that can cause the same symptoms as RSV. He also had a bout with H1N1, which is a type of flu. He also had a bout with MMR, which is a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella.

The Czech Republic has been dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak since late 2019. The fourth wave of the outbreak, which the narrator references, began in mid-March 2020 and has caused 30,000 deaths as of April 2023. The narrator believes that the situation will not improve until the government enforces strict measures to limit the spread of the virus. These measures include requiring people to wear masks in public, requiring people to wear masks in public places such as schools and workplaces, and requiring people to wear face masks at all times. The narrator also believes that the government's decision to lift mandatory mask requirements in schools was a mistake, as this decision allowed the virus to spread more widely. The narrator also believes that the government's decision to pay testing sites less than what they are owed will lead to more inaccurate test results, which will lead to more false negatives and more people who are infected but not aware of it. The narrator also believes that the populists' decision to implement populist measures, such as requiring people to get vaccinated against diseases with mandatory mask requirements, will lead to more people getting infected with these diseases and more","8

The situation is somewhat familiar. I've experienced something similar before. The Ontario Premier is a bit trigger happy and doesn't take into account the human cost of his orders. He doesn't seem to care about the lives lost. He's more concerned about the number of cases. He's not a doctor and doesn't understand the severity of the situation. He's just following the orders of the medical professionals.

The second option is to get a vaccination in the UK, but this would not provide a minimum level of immunity, and would also require a minimum amount of time to be vaccinated.

I believe the narrator is struggling with the idea of getting a vaccination in the UK, because they do not want to get stuck in a situation where they cannot get a minimum level of immunity, and are worried that the UK will not believe them if they claim they already had a vaccination. On the other hand, I believe the narrator is struggling with the idea of getting a second vaccination in South Korea, because they do not want to get stuck in a situation where they cannot get a minimum level of immunity, and are worried that the South Korea will not believe them if they claim they already had a vaccination.

### End","While it is true that the UK and South Korea are not fully aligned on vaccination, the UK is not completely aligned with either country. For example, the UK allows for the importation of unvaccinated foreign children to the UK, and South Korea allows for the importation of unvaccinated foreign children to South Korea.

The UK is also not aligned with other countries that do not allow for the importation of unvaccinated foreign children to the UK. For example, the US does not allow for the importation of unvaccinated foreign children to the UK, but the UK allows for the importation of unvaccinated foreign children to the UK.

Overall, the UK is not aligned with many countries on this issue, and the UK is not completely aligned with either South Korea or the US.

The situation was caused by Covid-19, which is a virus that can be transmitted via coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes Covid-19 can live on surfaces for up to 3 hours, so it's important to wash your hands frequently and stay home if you're sick.

My family member had Covid-19 because they were in close contact with someone who had Covid-19. They were also in close contact with other people who didn't have Covid-19, so they didn't get infected from the virus.

Based on the provided input, the narrator is preparing for her 15-month old to attend her first family birthday party. The party will be outdoors, and most of the adults are vaccinated. There will be kids under 9 years old at the party, and most of those kids go to daycares/schools. The narrator is nervous, as this is a situation outside of her control. She is asking everyone who interacts with her toddler to wear a mask if they are not vaccinated, as she is worried about catching something from people who are not vaccinated.
Based on this context, I would say that the circumstances are partially responsible for causing this situation. The situation is caused by the birthday party, which is outside of the control of the narrator. However, the circumstances beyond anyone's control (such as the weather) are not responsible for causing this situation.

### End","The situation was fairly unfair. The news sources were reporting on COVID-19 deaths without any context, which made it seem like everyone who died from COVID-19 was a healthy young adult. In reality, many of the people who died were elderly or had underlying health conditions. This made the situation seem unfair.

### End","I'm not sure if I'm responsible for causing the covid pandemic. I'm not sure what I should be looking for when it comes to filtration efficiency. I assume I should be looking at ""viral filtration efficiency"" scores/tests but for what particle size? I seem to recall hearing that your typical covid aerosol is about 0.3 micrometers in diameter but I could definitely be wrong about that. I'm guessing I can simply close off a valve with some kind of solid object, but I'm not sure. Certainly, I want to avoid risking spreading the virus to others in the case that I become infected (I suppose one might argue that with properly wearing a very protective mask I am unlikely to be infected in the first place. Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though)

### End","7

### End","I think other people are responsible for causing the situation because:
- The number of covid cases is increasing exponentially
- The number of covid tests per capita is decreasing exponentially
- The number of people wearing masks is decreasing exponentially
- The number of people washing their hands is decreasing exponentially
- The number of people social distancing is decreasing exponentially
- The number of people avoiding public places is decreasing exponentially

### End","7

### End","Because the situation was caused by Covid-19, which is a virus that can only be spread through physical contact, the narrator is assuming that the mask is able to filter out viruses that are smaller than 0.3 micrometers, which is the typical size of an airborne virus. However, the narrator also states that the mask is able to filter out 95% of viruses, which is a very high filtration efficiency. Therefore, the narrator is assuming that the mask is not able to filter out other factors, such as luck, or the weather, or some other factors outside of the mask's control.

### End","7

### End","Because my mother smokes a lot, and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike, I need a high degree of protection. Whether I'm severely paranoid or otherwise, 95% filtration efficiency is not enough to satisfy me.

### End","7

### End","I think other people are controlling what is happening in the situation because:
- I'm not allowed to go outside

- I can't go to the store to buy medicine
- I can't go to the store to buy groceries
- I can't go outside to get fresh air
- I can't go outside to exercise

I can control whether I use the mask for the right amount of time or not. I can control whether I put on the mask before I go outside or not. I can control whether I take off the mask when I'm done or not. I can control whether I wash my hands after I take off the mask or not","NA

### End","The narrator is describing a mask they are considering purchasing. The mask is described as providing a high degree of protection against covid. The narrator is concerned about the risk of spreading the virus through the mask, and is looking for a mask with a high filtration efficiency. The filtration efficiency is described as being able to filter out particles smaller than 0.3 micrometers. The narrator is concerned that the mask may not be effective at filtering out smaller particles, and thus may be exposing the narrator to the virus through the mask.

### End","7 - Narrator thought that: Very much effort was needed.

The narrator clearly thought they needed to exert a lot of effort to deal with the situation.

### End","The narrator clearly thought they needed to exert a lot of effort to deal with the situation because they were experiencing a high degree of uncertainty and risk. The Covid-19 pandemic was spreading rapidly, and the narrator's country was in the middle of a covid delta variant spike, meaning that the number of cases was increasing very rapidly. The narrator was concerned that they might be infected, and they didn't know how to protect themselves. The mask they were considering was very effective at protecting others from inhaling particles, but it wouldn't protect them from getting infected themselves.

### End","I don't know why you would want to attend a wedding if you are worried about being exposed to people who are unvaccinated and not wearing masks. It seems like you would be much better off staying home and avoiding catching a potentially life-threatening disease.

### End","I don't know what your health anxiety is about, but I think you should attend the wedding. The wedding is a celebration of your family member getting married, and it is a great opportunity to see your family member get married and to celebrate your family member's marriage with other family members. It is not a good idea to avoid social events because of health anxiety. Health anxiety is a very common mental health issue, and it is not a good idea to ignore it. It is better to get a J&J vaccine and wear a mask if you think you might get a bad reaction to the vaccine. But even if you don't get a J&J vaccine, you can still attend the wedding. You can also take a break from the wedding if you feel anxious. You can go outside for a walk or a run, or you can go to a local coffee shop and read a book. You can also take a vacation by going somewhere with good air quality.

### End","The narrator does not know their own health anxiety level, so they rate it ""NA"". However, they do know that their family member is getting married, and they want to go to the wedding. They also know that the pandemic has made them feel anxious about being in large groups, and that they live in an area with low vaccination rates and no mask wearing. So, they know that there will be unvaccinated people at the wedding, and they know that the J&J vaccine is not 100% effective. Based on this, I would say that the narrator's desire to attend the wedding is moderately consistent with their knowledge of the situation.

### End","I'm concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and the availability of masks to protect others from infection. I'd like to buy a high-quality mask to protect myself and others, but the available masks are expensive and in short supply. If I buy a mask, I'd like to be able to use it to protect others, so I'm considering modifying a mask so that it's not valved. I could use a solid material to cover the valve, but I'm concerned that the valve may be fragile and could break, allowing air to leak and allowing the mask to fail in a manner that doesn't protect me. I don't want to damage the mask, but I also don't want to be exposed to COVID-19 if I use the mask, and I don't want to expose others to COVID-19 if I don't wear a mask.

### End","The narrator thought they were able to emotionally cope with the situation because they were busy distracting themselves from the problem.

I'm not sure if I'm understanding this correctly, but you're saying that other people are controlling what is happening in the situation by making the mask that is available to you?  If that is the case, then you should not be controlling what is happening in the situation by covering the valve with something solid.  You should be controlling what is happening in the situation by not buying the mask in the first place.

### End","Because your mother is at risk, and you are concerned for her safety.  It is not your responsibility to protect other people from the risks that you face.  If your mother wants you to buy a mask, it is your responsibility to support her decision, not try to convince her to do something she does not want to do.

I think the best course of action is to buy a non-valved mask and wear it in public places where there is a high likelihood of people (e.g. grocery stores, pharmacies, doctor's offices, etc.) If you're concerned about getting infected, it's better to wear a non-valved mask in these places than to put your mother at risk by wearing a valved mask in a public place.

My wife's parents are in a COVID bubble, and they refuse to get exposed to the outside world. My cofounder and I need to build a more regular working cadence and relationship, but my in-laws are not comfortable with me working in person with him.

First, I think it's important to note that the CDC has updated their guidance on who should get a Covid vaccine. The original guidance recommended that only people who had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 should get the vaccine. The new guidance recommends that people who have had close contact with a person who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, but who do not have symptoms, should also get the vaccine. The rationale is that the vaccine will provide some level of immunity even if the person does not develop symptoms. 
Second, I think it's important to note that the vaccine is not 100% effective. The CDC reports that the effectiveness of the vaccine is between 40% and 85% for people who have received two doses. So, even if you received two doses of the vaccine, you may still get COVID-19 even if you do not develop symptoms.

The vaccine was supposed to protect people from the virus, but instead it caused a different virus that was even more deadly.

The vaccine was rushed to market without enough testing, and the government covered up the risks.

The government now recommends the vaccine for everyone, but it’s too late to reverse the damage.

People who refused the vaccine will get the more deadly virus, and those who got the vaccine will likely die from it.

The narrator was able to move to the UK soon after the pandemic started because they had family in the UK. They had the knowledge that they could move to the UK, and that it would be relatively easy to do so. They also had the resources to make the move, as they had a job that allowed them to take time off to make the move, and they were able to take advantage of a program that allowed them to make the move for free.

I suppose I could answer ""because I'm concerned about my lungs"" or ""because I'm trying to get a visa to the UK and I need to demonstrate that I have sufficient lung capacity to survive in the UK"". I don't know why I'm being asked this, but I'll answer anyways. I don't think the situation is relevant to my goals and desires. I'm not concerned about my lungs, I'm not trying to get a visa to the UK, and I don't have sufficient lung capacity to survive in the UK.

Because I'm so tired of people saying ""vaccines prevent against hospitalization!"". I don't want to just avoid being hospitalized, I want to avoid permanent lung damage. People with mild or even asymptomatic covid are often left with permanent lung damage, but no one is talking about it. Do you want COPD and fibrosis lungs? I certainly don't. I'm moving to the UK soon and with tbe Delta variant raging I feel like a sitting duck. I'm so scared and hopeless because if I get Covid there's nothing I can do to save my lungs from fibrosing. We have to learn to ""live with covid"", so where are the treatments to make it tolerable?

The situation is somewhat consistent with the external and social norms. The narrator is not allowed to go anywhere, nor does she have a job that requires her to travel. She is also getting side effects from the vaccine, such as a sore arm and headache. However, the situation is not consistent with what the larger community defines as right or wrong. For example, cheating during an exam is wrong, or cutting a queue is frowned upon by others.

So ""Situation was: Completely unexpected"" is actually a neutral rating, not a 1 rating. And ""Situation was: Completely expected"" is actually a 9 rating, not a 5 rating.

I think you should choose a scale that makes more sense, like this:

1 being ""Situation was: Completely unexpected"", 2 being ""Situation was: Neutral"", and 3 being ""Situation was: Completely expected"".

Then the scale would make more sense, and people would be more likely to understand it.

However, I don't think the situation is consistent with the values of not killing animals. The narrator is not killing animals for food.

I don't think the situation is consistent with the values of being respectful. The narrator is expressing concern about the safety of the vaccine, which is understandable. However, I don't think the situation is respectful. The narrator is being rude to the doctor, and they are not being respectful to the doctor.

The shortages have also impacted people who are more concerned about cost, because the vaccines are more expensive. The shortages have also impacted people who are more concerned about safety, because the vaccines have been less safe.

Rate on a scale from 1 to 9, with 1 being ""Situation was: Completely inconsistent"", 5 being ""Neutral"", and 9 being ""Situation was: Completely consistent"". If the text doesn't address this question, please mark it as ""NA"".

New Jersey and New York both have high rates of COVID-19 transmission, but the case numbers are still much lower than the numbers seen in the unvaccinated regions.

It's really confusing because it seems like other sources are contradicting each other. I think its because 45% of people in Ohio are fully vaccinated, and 55% of Ohioans are vaccinated. So 45% of people who are fully vaccinated are not fully vaccinated, and 55% of people who are not fully vaccinated are fully vaccinated. So 45% of 55% is about 27%, which is close to the reported number of 28%. But I'm not sure if this is the actual percentage of fully vaccinated people in Ohio.

- The narrator's personal values - is the narrator a proponent of vaccinations, or does the narrator have reservations about vaccinations?
- The narrator's knowledge of the situation - if the narrator only has superficial knowledge of the situation, their personal values may not be well aligned with the narrator.
- Other external factors - external factors such as the political climate or the media environment may also influence the alignment of the narrator's personal values with the situation.

### End","I believe the Ohio department of health is reporting the 48% figure, but other sources are reporting other numbers. It's really confusing.

I expect that news sources may be reporting conflicting statistics because the statistics are not from the same source. The Ohio department of health is a government agency, whereas other news sources may be reporting statistics from a non-government organization.

The conflicting statistics may also be due to a lack of understanding of how to report statistics. For example, 45% of people in Ohio are fully vaccinated may be reported as 45% of Ohioans are fully vaccinated, whereas 45% of people in Ohio are vaccinated may be reported as 55% of Ohioans are vaccinated.

I'm not a doctor, but I would say it's unlikely that a french kiss would transmit the virus. The virus lives on the surface of your mouth for a few seconds, and then gets sucked into your nasal cavity. The virus can also live on the surface of your hands for a few seconds, but it's not clear how long that would last. But, it's also not clear how much virus is on your hands, so it's hard to say for sure.

I'm a pretty big animal lover and I don't eat meat, so the fact that I got Covid and then got a cold is really frustrating. I've been taking vitamins, drinking loads of water, and using paracetamol and ibuprofen to try and alleviate the symptoms, but it's not working. I'm worried that I might have to go to the doctor to get tested for Covid again, which would be really disappointing. I'm also worried that I might have to go to quarantine for 14 days, which would be a huge inconvenience. I'm just not sure what else I can do.

Some students and parents are concerned that this will lead to more social distancing and the wearing of masks, which were recommended for the first 8th grade but not required this year. Others are concerned that the virus may have mutated and that the masks may no longer be effective.

That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask.

### End","I don't know if I am responsible for the rise of covid cases in the Netherlands. I am a young person, and I do have a job that involves being around people. However, I do feel like I am not taking proper precautions to protect myself. I am not wearing a mask when I am outside, for example. I also feel like I am not taking proper precautions inside my house, like not coughing in my hands and not sharing glasses and such. I am not sure if I am actually causing more problems than I am solving by not following the rules.

I went to a movie today. I took occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it","I don't know why the narrator felt responsible for the situation.

### End","I'm not sure if I was fully masked or not, but I do know that I took occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I was also fully vaccinated, so I don't think I caught the virus from not wearing a mask.

I suffered from high blood pressure for about a month and a half. I didn't know I had it, because I never took my blood pressure regularly. I was diagnosed when I went to the doctor for a regular checkup. I was surprised, but I was able to emotionally cope with it by distracting myself from the problem. I ate comfort food and watched TV to avoid thinking about it. I also drank alcohol, which helped me relax. I'm seeing a cardiologist now, and I'm on medication to lower my blood pressure.

### End","3. I thought I was able to cope, but then I realized I didn't know much about heart inflammation so I Googled it and now I feel like I'm even more confused.

### End","Sure, I can tell you a bit about heart inflammation and why it happens after the vaccine. I'm not a doctor though, so take this with a grain of salt. The inflammation is caused by the body's immune system going into overdrive and attacking the heart muscle. The immune system is designed to protect the body from foreign invaders, but it can go too far and cause collateral damage to healthy tissue. The inflammation can cause the heart to work harder, which can cause damage over time. The damage can cause the heart to work less efficiently, which can cause more inflammation. It's a vicious cycle.

The vaccine doesn't cause heart inflammation, but it can increase the risk of it happening. The vaccine contains a small amount of a substance called adjuvants, which are added to the vaccine to help the immune system respond to it. Adjuvants are known to cause inflammation in the body. So, the vaccine can increase the risk of heart inflammation, but it doesn't cause it.

So, I'm bracing myself, because I think my partner is correct, but my anxiety is firing on all cylinders. Does anyone have some reassurance around going and getting dental work done? Words of encouragement? Has anyone had to go do some emergency dental work during the pandemic?

I'm not living here and I have a small window of time. 
Got my first shot, my next one is a little over a week away. 
After that I have just enough time to let it kick in (to be honest, a couple days short, I messed up my flights a bit) before I fly out again. 
My luck has been horrific for this whole pandemic though, and of course I can't count on anything going well, so I'm unsurprised that I have managed to crack an entire molar and I need to get it looked at urgently. 
In spite of being pretty good about my dental hygiene in the past, I've put off my annual dentist check ups for two years because of this shitty pandemic. 
I kind of have to do something about this, but I'm scared. 
Rationally I know I have some protection nearly two weeks out from my first jab, and there's a strong chance that the dentists I see here would all have been vaccinated ages ago. 
I guess I could try to push it off even longer, but when I return to my home country, I'm going to a place where there are way less vaccinations that have been distributed","I'm not living here and I have a small window of time.

A ""breakthrough case"" is a term used by the media to refer to someone who got very sick from the vaccine, but a ""normal"" number of people who got the vaccine did not become very sick.

Assuming that all of the other 23 states have the exact same amount, we can estimate that there are around 130,000 people with full vaccinations who have not gotten a breakthrough infection. This means that, statistically, out of the 160 million people who have received the vaccinations, only about 99.92% have not gotten a breakthrough infection.

The narrator is concerned about the side effects of the vaccines and wants to know if they should take the risk of getting a different vaccine.

These concerns are valid, and the narrator should take them into consideration before making a decision. However, the narrator is not concerned about the irretrievable loss of a loved one, because they do not think that they are unable to reverse the outcome of the situation.

The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on how and where people work. In this section, we explore how people have adapted to working from home, and the challenges that arise.

Working from home has been a boon for some, but for others it has been a challenge. For some, it has been a welcome change, while for others it has been a source of stress. For some, it has been a relief from the office, but for others it has been a source of anxiety.

Working from home has its advantages. It can be a way to save on commuting costs, and it can be a way to spend more time with family. It can also be a way to be more productive, as you can work on a task without distraction.

But working from home can also be a challenge. It can be difficult to maintain a social life, and it can be difficult to make new friends. It can be difficult to meet people, and it can be difficult to make new connections.

First, I think it's important to note that the situation the narrator is describing is not his/her responsibility. It's the responsibility of the person who invited him/her to the party. 
Second, I think it's important to distinguish between a personal and a professional relationship. The narrator is a friend of the family, and he/she should support them in whatever decision they make. But he/she should not try to influence the decision. That's the role of a professional, which the narrator is in this case. 
Third, I think it's important to distinguish between a physical distance and a time distance. The 200 miles between the narrator and the family is a physical distance. But the time distance is the one the narrator should focus on. He/she should not try to influence the family by sending them the vaccine, because that's not what they want to hear. He/she should send the vaccine if the family asks for it. But he/she should not try to convince them to get vaccinated. That's not his/her role.","4

Delta airlines has a very interesting take on getting people vaccinated. They have a few different incentives. The first is a bonus for getting your flu shot. The second is a discount for getting your kiddos vaccinated. The third is a status symbol for being able to say you got your flu shot or your kiddos vaccinated.

These incentives are interesting because they are not monetary. They are non-monetary. They are not about saving money. They are not about status. They are about improving the health of the people who are most important to you - your family.

### End","I often hear that COVID could become endemic among the unvaccinated if we don't reach herd immunity through vaccinations. However, I think the argument is flawed because it doesn't take into account the role of variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandem","7

### End","The narrator is expressing uncertainty about the efficacy of natural immunity. They are expressing uncertainty about the efficacy of natural immunity because they are hearing this argument from people who are not experts in the field of natural immunity, and they are concerned that the argument is not based on facts. The narrator is also expressing uncertainty because they are concerned that the argument implies that there is a single, universal, effective form of natural immunity that protects against all variants of a virus. The narrator is not sure that this is true, and they are concerned that the argument implies that there is a single, universal, effective form of natural immunity that protects against all variants of a virus.

### End","7

### End","I don't know if the narrator is a fan of fairness, but I think the scale they are using is too subjective. For example, how do you measure the ""optimal survival conditions"" of a virus? And even if we assume that a virus can be measured in such a way, how do you measure the ""point of peak fitness"" of a virus? Peak fitness could be defined as the point at which a virus has evolved to the optimal conditions for survival, but how do you measure the ""optimal conditions for survival""?

They also mention that they've heard that natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, which would suggest that they care about the suffering of humans.

Overall, I think the narrator cares about animal welfare and human suffering, and I think they think the situation is consistent with those values.

The novel coronavirus has caused more than 676 million cases and 6.88 million deaths, according to a new report from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The report, published April 3, 2020, is the most comprehensive look at the global impact of the pandemic to date.

The report's authors found that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on people in low- and middle-income countries, where more than 80 percent of Covid-19 cases and more than 90 percent of Covid-19-related deaths have occurred. The report also found that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on people of color and on people with underlying health conditions.

The pandemic has also had a significant impact on young people, who make up a growing share of the U.S. population. The report found that more than half of all Covid-19 cases and more than three-quarters of Covid-19-related deaths have occurred among people between the ages of 20 and 44.

He is due to start again as an employee hopefully next weekend. This suggests that he was not working during the pandemic.

He and I both fully vaccinated with Moderna. This suggests that he and I are in a similar situation, where we can get the Moderna vaccine.

He has a daughter who is not eligible to be vaccinated. This suggests that he is in a situation where he can't get the vaccine for his daughter.

Based on the above, I would assume that he was expecting to get the Moderna vaccine, and that he was planning to start working again soon. However, he got the vaccine but his daughter was not eligible, which was unexpected.

I want to preface by saying that I know everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to COVID. That said, I need advice. My husband and I are both double vaccinated but our children are not (all under 12). Unfortunately, my husbands grandmother passed away a couple days ago in another province and he is already talking about traveling for the service. We have been super careful through out the pandemic as I have an immune condition so curbside pick up, remote learning and distancing from our family and friends (with the exception of outdoor visits) has been our norm. While my husband would travel alone, this is a BIG change for us. He seems quite comfortable going-me not so much. I'm concerned about the delta variant. I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off","I think the narrator is concerned about their children not having any protection against COVID-19, and worries about their husband traveling alone to attend the funeral of his grandmother, who passed away in another province. The narrator also mentions that their children are under the age of 12, which means they are not vaccinated for certain diseases. The narrator also mentions that they are both vaccinated for COVID-19, but their children are not.
I don't know if the narrator is correct to be concerned about their children not being vaccinated, and not being able to prevent their children from being infected with COVID-19. However, I don't know if the narrator has considered other factors that could contribute to their children being unvaccinated, or not being able to receive the vaccine. For example, the narrator mentions that their children are under the age of 12, and that their children are not vaccinated for certain diseases. The diseases that children under the age of 12 are not vaccinated for include polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox. It is also possible that the children are not vaccinated for COVID-19 because the children's doctor did not recommend the vaccination for COVID-19. It is also possible that the children's insurance does not cover the vaccination for COVID-","7

### End","I don't know why you would want to travel for a funeral.  That seems like a really bad idea.  I would recommend waiting until the whole family is vaccinated before your husband travels.  It sounds like you are already following all the social distancing recommendations, so your husband should be able to keep himself safe, but if he doesn't have the vaccine, he is at risk of getting the virus and bringing it home to your family.  That is a really big risk, and one that you don't want to take.  You can't make him stay home, and you can't make him not travel, so you are left with a really tough choice.  He can either wait until your family is vaccinated, or he can go without you, but he can't do both.  If he waits, he can still catch the virus and bring it home to your family, but he will have some protection from the vaccine.  If he goes without you, he will be completely unprotected and at risk of getting the virus and bringing it home to your family.  I hope you make the right choice for your family!

Or, it could be that the children are simply less likely to be exposed to their grandparents, who are the primary source of the virus for the narrator's husband.

### End","7.  Situation would get: Better

I'm so sorry your husband tested positive for the flu this week.  It can be a scary and overwhelming time, and I'm here to help.

First, I'm so sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis.  The flu can be very dangerous, even for people who are vaccinated.  I recommend that you both get the flu shot, and that you both get a yearly flu shot, too.  It can help protect you both from the flu, and also help to reduce the severity of the flu in those who are at higher risk for more severe flu symptoms, such as children, the elderly, and people with certain health conditions.

Second, I recommend that you both get plenty of rest.  Your husband may be feeling tired, but he is also likely experiencing other flu symptoms, such as a fever, chills, and a cough.  Rest will help your husband recover more quickly, and also help to reduce the risk of you both getting the flu.

Third, I recommend that you both take plenty of fluids.  Your husband may be feeling dehydrated, and that can make the flu symptoms worse.  He should drink plenty of water, and also take electrolyte","I recommend that my husband and I both get the flu shot, and that we both get a yearly flu shot, too.

However, this raises a number of questions. 

First, how exactly do you administer a vaccine? You can't just go to a doctor's office and get a shot, you need to be seen in a medical setting. This means that you need to either lie about getting the vaccine from a doctor, or find a doctor who will administer the vaccine without verifying your insurance status.

Second, what if you can't get the vaccine? What if you live in a location where there is no provider for the vaccine? Or what if you don't have insurance? In this case, you'll either have to find a way to pay out of pocket, or lie to your doctor about your insurance status.

They didn't eat at restaurants, saw friends, wore a mask everywhere, and still treated mail as though it could contain virus. They knew that even if they got COVID, it would be mild since they were vaccinated. But they still felt anxious, especially with the probably third wave we were entering in the US.

I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.

My parents say I shouldn't ""risk it"" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. Can anyone help assessing me on making this choice? Thanks beforehand.

### End","The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation. The situation is that the narrator's girlfriend needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. The reason is that because of the narrator's work, they are out on the street often and the narrator needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected themselves.

### End","7

### End","The narrator thinks that the situation is familiar because they experienced a similar situation in the past (i.e., they got vaccinated in December and now they are considering on getting a second dose).

### End","NA: The narrator did not think that they needed to exert any effort to deal with the situation.

### End","I'm not sure if this question is applicable to the current situation, since the narrator is back in Mexico for the summer and doesn't need to get vaccinated again. However, I'll try my best to answer it anyway.

The narrator is concerned about mixing two mRNA vaccines, since this might compromise the efficacy of the vaccine. However, I don't think the narrator is concerned about mixing the vaccines, since the Moderna vaccine only requires one dose.

The narrator is concerned about getting infected by their girlfriend, since she is immunosupressed. However, I don't think the narrator is concerned about getting infected by going outside, since going outside is required to keep up with their relationship.

### End","NA

### End","I don't know why you would want to mix mRNA vaccines. It's not like they are particularly effective.

### End","I think the situation is consistent with my personal values. I am a Mexican citizen studying in France, and I got vaccinated with Moderna in December, and they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December, and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know.

I apologize beforehand for making yet another question about this subject. But I can't seem to find specific information that relates to my particular case... I am a Mexican citizen studying in France. While in France, some months ago I got vaccinated with Moderna, yet they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated.
