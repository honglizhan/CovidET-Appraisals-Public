I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.

Narrator thought they were: Completely needed

### End","I'm not sure if I answered the question as fully as I could have. I'll try again, but first, let me explain what the scale is actually for.

The scale is for rating the importance of attending to a situation. For example, if a person is applying for a job, and the narrator of the application is asked to rate how important it is to attend to the situation, they might rate the importance as a 7 or a 9. A 7 means the narrator thinks the applicant will not be successful at the job unless they attend to the situation, and a 9 means the narrator thinks the applicant will be successful at the job if they attend to the situation.

So, why did I rate the situation as not at all needed? I didn't think I needed to attend to the situation. I already knew what the situation was, and I already knew what the outcome would be. I didn't need to hear it from someone else.

If I had to rate the situation again, I might give it a 6 or a 8. I might rate it as more important to hear the outcome from someone else than I did before. But I wouldn't rate it as a 9 or a 7.

### End","The narrator is aware that something has been irretrievably lost, and they are rating the extent of the loss on a scale from 1 to 9. The scale is not symmetric, so the narrator is rating the extent of the loss as being significantly less safe than if they waited two weeks.

The text does not provide any context to justify the narrator's rating of the extent of the loss. It is possible that the narrator is comparing the risk of catching a disease in the short term (two weeks) to the risk of catching a disease in the long term (after the vaccination). However, it is also possible that the narrator is comparing the risk of catching a disease in the long term (after the vaccination) to the risk of not catching a disease in the long term (after the vaccination).

For example, the narrator may believe that it's important to not kill animals for food, and so they would rate the situation as ""7"" (completely consistent with their personal values).

However, it's also important to note that the narrator is a person who is not a medical expert, and so their answer to this question is based on their understanding of the situation, and their personal values. The narrator may believe that it's safe to go now, because they don't believe that the vaccine is significantly less effective if it's been 2 months since the second dose, and they believe that the second dose is significantly more effective than the first dose. In this case, the narrator's answer to the question is ""7"" (completely consistent with their personal values), even though they may be mistaken in this belief.

The delta variant is a more aggressive form of the virus that causes the common cold. The moderna vaccine is designed to protect against both the common cold and the more severe delta variant. The delta variant is less well understood than the common cold, but it is believed that the moderna vaccine provides some protection against the delta variant.

There is some evidence that the moderna vaccine may provide some protection against the common cold. However, there is not yet enough evidence to say whether the delta variant is less well understood than the common cold, or whether the moderna vaccine provides any protection against the delta variant.

Regardless, it is important to note that the moderna vaccine does not provide complete protection against the common cold. The common cold can still cause symptoms, and it is important to maintain good hygiene and take regular medication to manage symptoms.

### End","I don't know much about the situation in Iceland, but I do know that Astra Zeneca is a pharmaceutical company. So, I'm going to assume that the vaccine in question is a pharmaceutical vaccine. Pharmaceutical vaccines are typically made from dead or weakened viruses, and are often combined with an adjuvant, which is a substance that helps the immune system respond more effectively to the vaccine. 
The first shot is made from a weakened virus, so it won't cause any harm to the recipient. The second shot is made from the same weakened virus, but with a booster dose of the real virus, so it will be more effective. 
So, in this case, the first shot is a weakened vaccine, and the second shot is a real vaccine. The second shot is more effective because it's more effective at fighting the virus. 
However, the second shot is only effective if the recipient is exposed to the real virus. So, if the recipient is in Iceland during the time that the second shot is supposed to be effective, then they will need to get exposed to the real virus in order for the vaccine to be effective. 
If the recipient is not exposed to the real virus, then the vaccine is actually less effective, because it's not","The situation in Iceland is somewhat consistent with social norms.

The narrator was given the opportunity to receive a vaccination at a recent family gathering, and they took the opportunity to share their experience with others.

The narrator also describes the event as ""taking an older relative for her first Pfizer dose"" because they were able to participate in the event together, and they were happy to be able to give their relative a memorable experience. The narrator also describes the event as ""not many people showed up"" because they were happy to be able to participate with others, and they were concerned that others would not be able to participate. The narrator also describes the event as ""all accompanying family members were offered the shot and give papers for a second dose"" because they were able to participate with others, and they were able to give their relative a second dose so that they could receive the vaccination.

If you experience any other symptoms that are not listed here, please see your doctor.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part.

I don't think the narrator is talking about the general public in the US or anywhere else with high vaccination rates.  I think the narrator is talking about the WHO themselves, and the Delta variant.  

The WHO has a history of making over-the-top statements that are not based in science, and the public tends to discount their statements.  For example, in the early 2000s, the WHO declared that SARS was a bioweapon created by the Chinese government to harm China.  This was a complete fabrication, but the public believed it, and the WHO suffered from a credibility crisis.  

The Delta variant is a new mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  It is believed to be less transmissible than the other three main variants, but more transmissible than the original SARS-CoV-2.  The public does not yet have a lot of data about the Delta variant, so people are still largely unvaccinated or under-vaccinated against it.  If the public does not have a lot of data about it, it is more likely to make over-the-top statements about it being more transmissible than the other three main variants.

The WHO says that even fully vaxxed people need to go back to masking and social distancing because of the Delta variant. This means that even people who have had multiple vaccines and are therefore immune to the virus, should still be careful because of the newly discovered mutation. The mutation is more dangerous than the original virus, and therefore more dangerous to those who are not immune.

People who are not immune to the original virus should not go out in public, and people who are immune should continue to go out in public but should be careful.

First, it's important to note that the situation is very fluid and it's possible that the health department will change their mind or alter their recommendations. It's also possible that the situation will improve and they will change their mind again.

Second, it's possible that the situation is already getting worse for people who don't have access to healthcare or basic necessities. This could include people who are homeless or living in crowded conditions, people who are working in essential services but who can't afford to stay home, and people who are incarcerated and unable to access healthcare or basic necessities.

I think this is a good opportunity to discuss what it means to ""mask up indoors"". I think it's good advice for everyone, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask indoors to help prevent the spread of viruses. However, I think it's important to note that the advice to mask up is not without controversy.

I think this is a good opportunity to discuss what we should be prioritizing when deciding how to ""mask up"".

First, we should be prioritizing the safety of ourselves and our families. Wearing a mask will not protect us from the virus, but it will help prevent the spread of the virus by keeping us away from others. Wearing a mask will not change the fact that we are all in close contact with others, and we should all be taking steps to reduce the spread of the virus by washing our hands, avoiding touching our faces, and staying home if we are sick.

The following is a response that addresses the question posed in the input above.

Dear Reader,

Thank you for your inquiry.

Unfortunately, we do not have any information regarding the availability of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines in the United States.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

Amy

### End","I would really appreciate if you could tell me if the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are available in the United States.

### End","NA

### End","The situation is challenging because there is no AstraZeneca vaccine available in the United States, and the narrator needs to make a decision on what to do. They could either wait for the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine to become available, which may take a month, or take the mixed vaccine from Canada or EU, which may already be available. The mixed vaccine may not be approved in the United States, so the narrator would need to consult a doctor for a prescription. The mixed vaccine may not be as effective, but it would be a step towards getting vaccinated.

Assuming the narrator is a vegan, it seems like they would have concerns about the ethics of using animal products as a second dose, since the first dose was from AstraZeneca, which produces animal products. However, it is not clear whether the narrator is concerned about the use of animal products, or just the fact that they are not available to receive.

Regardless, it seems like the mixed vaccination approach taken in Canada and EU would alleviate the ethical concerns. However, it is not clear whether the narrator is aware of this approach, or if they would consider it.

### End","I think other people are controlling to some extent because the narrator is worried about the risk of infection from Delta Variant, and yet she also goes to work, goes to school, eats and drinks, and takes public transit. She also takes her dog for a walk, but doesn't mention that in her description of her daily activities. She also mentions that she doesn't mind masks, but she doesn't mention that she also doesn't mind makeup. So it sounds like she is wearing two masks at once: one for the virus and one for the social norms around not wearing makeup.

### End","I don't think that the circumstances were controlling the situation in this case. I think that the situation was controlled by the people involved. The people who got the vaccine and the people who didn't. The people who got the vaccine had a higher risk of getting infected, but they still got the vaccine. The people who didn't get the vaccine didn't get the vaccine because they didn't want to get infected. So it was a choice between getting the vaccine and getting infected. The people who got the vaccine chose to get the vaccine, and the people who didn't get the vaccine didn't get the vaccine because they couldn't make the choice.

Delta is a highly contagious and deadly virus that is immune to all vaccines. It is believed that the vaccines cause the body to create antibodies to the virus, but the antibodies do not actually protect the body from the virus, but rather cause the body to attack its own organs. This causes organ failure.

The symptoms of Delta include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in some cases, death. The virus is believed to have first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where a wet market was discovered to be selling wild animals, such as bats, that contained the virus. The virus then spread to other countries, including Italy, the United States, and Iran.

The Chief Medical Officer of Ontario, Dr. Eileen de Villa, is looking at case numbers rather than hospitalizations. She is looking at the wrong thing, and is scaring the wrong thing, the public.

The text addresses this misconception by stating that the narrator thought that something irretrievable has been lost.

The situation is somewhat familiar. I've experienced something similar before. The Ontario premier is a bit trigger happy and doesn't take into account the consequences. He'll go ahead and lockdown the province even if there are no cases. The problem is that the number of hospitalizations and deaths are at single digits. He'll still go ahead and lockdown the province. The problem is that it's not the right decision. He'll be criticized for it later.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 

1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one

2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea 

Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy

The article discusses how Pfizer's Delta variant of the HIV vaccine was found to be much less effective than the Alpha variant. The narrator of the article expresses concern that this means that people who receive the vaccine may still be at risk for HIV, even if they receive the Alpha variant. However, the article also discusses how the lower efficacy of the Delta variant is not surprising, and that it is in fact the goal of vaccines to have lower efficacy so that people are more likely to develop a protective immune response. The article goes on to discuss how the lower efficacy of the Delta variant actually makes it easier to produce a highly effective vaccine, since it requires less vaccine to produce the same amount of protective immunity.

I can't attend because just the thought of being inside with that many people unmasked (and some unvaccinated) gives me extreme anxiety.

I don't know much about the vaccine, but I would say you should be able to attend. The delta virus is not very dangerous, and the vaccine is very effective at preventing it. If you get the vaccine, you should not have much anxiety about it.

First, it's important to recognize that your anxiety around COVID safety is not irrational. COVID is a very real threat to public health, and many people have died from it. The fear of dying from COVID or spreading it to someone else is a very real fear.

Second, it's important to remember that COVID is not the only threat to public health. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID, and they're fully vaccinated. So, while it's understandable that the narrator is anxious, it's also important to remember that this is not an entirely irrational fear.

The lockdowns that were put in place to try and flatten the curve of the virus' spread were arguably too extreme, and arguably caused more harm than good. But that's a debate for another time.

Regardless, the UK has now entered its third lockdown, and the situation has not improved. The number of cases continues to rise, and the number of hospitalisations continues to rise. The lockdowns have not stopped the spread of the virus, they have merely delayed it.

The UK's National Health Service is underfunded and overstretched, and is struggling to keep up with the demand for its services. The restrictions that have been put in place are arguably necessary, but they are also arguably too extreme.

I don't know what the solution is. I do know that the lockdowns have not worked, and will not work in the long term. We need to find a way to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, and we need to do so without subjecting the NHS to further strain.

### End","The situation is challenging because there is a moral conflict between the potential benefits of changing to another vaccine and the risks of changing to another vaccine. The potential benefits are that by changing to another vaccine, the narrator can minimize their risk of catching the novel virus and the risk of dying from the vaccine.

On the other hand, the community's response to the situation is very different from what the narrator is experiencing. The narrator is experiencing extreme stress and anxiety, and the community is reacting with empathy and understanding.

Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'.

### End","The situation is moderately consistent with external and social norms. The cousin is a professional tattoo artist and has been for many years. She has a sterling reputation and has never had a single client who became ill or died from a tattoo. The cousin has also vaccinated herself and her own children. The cousin is also unvaccinated and has chosen not to vaccinate her own children. The cousin has agreed to tattoo you, and you are free to cancel if you feel uncomfortable. However, it would be a shame to miss out on such a unique opportunity, and it would be a disservice to yourself and your health to not get this tattoo.

### End","The narrator is a fully vaccinated college student in the U.S. who needs to relocate to another part of the country in May for a summer internship. Because of this, the narrator can count on a single hand the number of times they've seen their friends since March 2020. The narrator is feeling increasingly worried that they will come back in August only to find it's gone back to not being safe to see anyone and classes have gone back to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since their home state is one of those states with low vaccination rates.

I think that other people were partially responsible for the lack of physical contact in my group, because they didn't take the initiative to go out and meet people.

It seems more likely that the narrator was simply unaware of the mask-wearing habits of others in the workshop, which would make it very difficult to predict what would happen next.

The narrator is clearly worried about the situation, and they are taking steps to try and prevent the infection from spreading to them. They are taking precautions at the airport, and they are also taking steps to try and get their boyfriend to the airport to visit them.

### End","I think the narrator is being overly optimistic in their assessment of the situation. While they may believe that they are contributing to the solution, I think it is more accurate to say that they are being overly optimistic about the progress that has been made so far. The United States has made slow progress in ramping up testing and contact tracing, and has not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation. The United States has also shown a lack of urgency in providing adequate resources to health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic, which has led to high rates of infection and death among these workers. The United States has also failed to provide adequate resources to low-income communities, which have borne the brunt of the pandemic's impact.

The situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values. For example, the narrator is a vegan and does not eat meat, so they would likely object to killing animals for food. However, the narrator also says they are not willing to wait until a vaccine is developed to cancel their trip to Italy and Morocco, so it is unclear how seriously they take the issue of animal welfare.

### End","I don't know why you chose this scale, but I think it's a bit confusing. The scale is from 1 to 9, with 1 being ""Situation was: Completely unexpected"", 5 being ""Neutral"", and 9 being ""Situation was: Completely expected"". So the neutral option is actually the expected situation.

But I'll explain my choice of numbers. I chose 1 and 9 because I think they are extreme ends of the spectrum. A situation that is ""Completely unexpected"" is not likely, so I chose 1. A situation that is ""Completely expected"" is not likely to be surprising, so I chose 9.

So my choice of numbers is 1 for ""Situation was: Completely unexpected"", and 9 for ""Situation was: Completely expected"".

I also do feel hot but I dont have a fever. I just want this to end and feel good again. Has anyone experienced the same and can anyone tell me if it gets better? Also to the women: has someone noticed changes in their menstrual cycle after getting the vaccine?

### End","I'm not sure if this is the case, but the narrator seems to be experiencing burnout. The text doesn't provide any context around how the situation is affecting the narrator's mental health, but the narrator's comments about feeling tired and anxious after hanging out with friends suggest that the narrator is not having fun and is instead feeling drained. The text doesn't provide any context around how the situation is affecting the friends the narrator is hanging out with, but it seems like the friends are not leaving the hangouts feeling satisfied either. The text doesn't provide any context around how the situation is affecting the narrator's productivity, but the narrator's comments about leaving early suggest that the narrator is feeling guilty about not being able to keep the friends around for longer. Burnout is a serious mental health issue, and the text doesn't provide any context around how the situation is affecting the narrator's mental health, so I recommend seeking professional help.

### End","I think the narrator is partially responsible for the situation, because they are partly responsible for their own actions, and they also didn't take into account external factors when making their decision. The vast majority of the state is vaccinated, and yet the cases are still going up. This means that the vast majority of the population is not vaccinated, and therefore, they are still at risk. However, the state government has not done enough to incentivize people to get vaccinated, and the narrator is partly to blame for that. The state government should do more to incentivize people to get vaccinated, and at the same time, they should not punish those who cannot get vaccinated, because that will just make them less likely to get vaccinated in the future.

### End","The situation is inconsistent with the external and social norms. Both states are experiencing high transmission rates, and case numbers are still low. The situation is also inconsistent with the internal norms, as both states are vaccinating their populations. The rate of transmission is a function of the amount of people who are immune vs. people who are susceptible, and the state is actively vaccinating their populations. Therefore, the rate of transmission should be low. Case numbers are also a function of the testing capacity and the ability to identify cases, which is also a function of the population being vaccinated. Therefore, case numbers should also be low.

### End","I don't know why I thought it was familiar, but I do know that it was not the first time I've seen a spike like this. I live in New Jersey, which has been experiencing a particularly bad outbreak. The numbers of cases and deaths have been climbing steadily since mid-March, and have been particularly high in the past few days. The numbers of cases and deaths in New Jersey are not as high as some of the other states experiencing surges, but they are still very high. 

I also live in New York City, which has been relatively unaffected by the outbreak so far. However, I do know that there have been cases in the city, and that the city has been taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

### End","7.  Narrator thought that: Very much effort was needed.

The situation is so bad that even if you don't expend any effort, you still might get a case.  So, you might as well expend the effort to avoid getting sick.

### End","Because of the severity of the situation, the narrator felt that expending any effort would be worthwhile.  Even if you expend no effort, you still might get a case, so expending the effort to avoid getting sick would be worthwhile.

### End","7

### End","The situation is challenging because both New Jersey and New York have low case numbers compared to other states, but the numbers are still high compared to what they were at the beginning of the pandemic. This suggests that either the measures in place are not working, or that the population is still largely immune.

### End","4/9
The situation is consistent with my personal values. I think that the rate of transmissions in both states are way too high, and that the number of cases are not corresponding to the actual number of people who got infected. However, I don't think that this is a reason to stop vaccinating, because the rate of transmissions is also high in other states that have a high vaccination rate.

### End","I don't know if I expected the situation to occur at all. The transmission rates in both states are still much lower than the levels seen in the unvaccinated regions during winter surge.

I'm not a doctor, but I would say it's unlikely that a french kiss would transmit the virus. The virus lives on the surface of your mouth for a few seconds, and then gets sucked into your nasal cavity, where it can be breathed in. The virus is not very strong in your saliva, and the french kiss is a very gentle action. I would say the risk of transmission is very low.

The situation described in the text is not fair. The physical therapist is treating a patient, but is allowing the patient to wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth, which is not in accordance with physical therapist hygiene standards.

The situation is not fair to the patient, who is not able to comply with physical therapist hygiene standards, and is therefore at risk of transmitting a disease.

### End","I don't know why, but I feel like this situation is completely familiar to me. I've been going to physical therapy for a few weeks. They require masks and do all the hygiene theatre (temp checks, wiping gear, etc). It's one big room and they only have 2-3 staff present with not more than three patients at a time. Okay, that's all fine and dandy, but today I walked in and they're finishing up with a new patient who is wearing his mask under his nose. My first thought is just the usual eye roll and judgements about people who behave this way. Then I come to terms with the fact that they were treating him and allowing this behavior, which IMO makes their mask policy complete BS. So, here's the thing, I'm vaccinated but I have a medically at-risk kid who is too young to get jabbed. Delta spread is high in our county and from what I've read, it might be more transmittable even by vaccinated people. I'm about halfway through my expected treatment and seeing good progress.

The kids who are going to receive the delayed vaccine are going to suffer greatly due to the fact that they will be deprived of the vaccine for an additional 4 months. This is not acceptable. IMO, the vaccine should come out sooner rather than later so that we do not have to suffer the consequences of kids not receiving it.

### End","I don't know much about the situation you are describing, but I'll take a stab at addressing the issue of expectation.  It seems like you are expecting the Las Vegas mask mandate to return to its previous state, which is unfortunate, but I don't think it is your primary concern.  I think the bigger issue is the fear of missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity due to the mask mandate.  I would recommend considering whether or not you actually need a mask to enjoy the trip, and if you do need a mask, whether or not you actually want to wear a mask.  If you don't need a mask, then you don't need to wear a mask.  If you do need a mask, but don't want to wear a mask, then you can still enjoy the trip without wearing a mask.  If you do want to wear a mask, then you can wear a mask, but you can also not wear a mask, and still enjoy the trip.  I hope this helps, and good luck on your trip!

I went to a movie today. I took occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it","I don't know why the narrator felt responsible for the situation. It's possible that the other people in the theater were not wearing masks, and the narrator was worried that they were carrying the virus.

This is exactly what needs to happen. In order to stop the virus from doing anymore damage to innocents (and to get us all out of this mess), more people have to be vaccinated. I hate to say it, but if it is the damage Delta is doing to the unvaccinated communities that is finally getting some of the stubborn, reluctant ones to take it, well, I don't know whether to consider Delta a blessing or a curse.

The first is about a situation where the narrator wants to see their unvaccinated friends and family, and the second is about a situation where the narrator's 4 year old son can't get vaccinated and is around anti-vaxxers. The first situation is consistent with the narrator's wants, while the second situation is inconsistent with the narrator's wants.

### End","The narrator is being overly cautious when they don't want to see their unvaccinated family and friends. They are being vaccinated and taking precautions, but the people who want to see them are not taking precautions. The people who want to see them also are the ones who go out all the time and don't wear masks. The narrator also knows that the risk of their son getting really sick is low, but they also want to see their unvaccinated family and friends. The narrator also doesn't want to see their unvaccinated family and friends because they are anti-mask and anti-covid vaccine. The narrator also doesn't want to see them because they are not respecting the narrator's personal values.

We know the risk to him is low and that he's very likely to be fine if he does get it.

We've been seeing our immediate family members and close friends who are all vaccinated, but we've stayed away from everyone we know who isn't vaccinated.

The issue were having is that the majority of both of our families are anti-covid vaccine and anti mask.

Most of them, especially the ones that want to see us, acted like covid didn't exist and were out all the time. These people now want to see us, or are being invited to all the functions so the only way to avoid them is to not go.

My MIL, and some of our other vaccinated friends are giving us a hard time and making us feel like we're being ridiculous by not seeing our unvaccinated family and friends.

So my question is are we being ridiculous? Are we being overly cautious when we shouldn't be? Because a lot of people are making us feel like we are. We know the chances of him getting really sick are low, but also realize that the people who want to see us/him are not taking any precautions and seeing a ton of other non-vaxers","4/9 - We know the risk to him is low and that he's very likely to be fine if he does get it.

They chose to ignore the advice from their friends and family and instead chose to follow their own instincts. Ultimately, they chose to ignore the data and instead chose to trust their own feelings.

This means that the number of cases is decreasing, which means the virus is less of a threat.

More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.

The situation seemed to be straightforward and not particularly challenging.

### End","The narrator is considering going to a funeral in Cleveland County NC. The vax rate there is about 40% and they have about 1 case per thousand per week right now. The funeral is on July 30. There will be a large group lunch at someone's home after the funeral. They will wear a masks and try to be outside at the lunch if they can. But the narrator has a week vacation to Bonaire planned, flying on August 7 and August 14. They will need a negative PCR test within 72 hours before both flights. The trip would be cancelled or they could not fly back on schedule and would be quarantined in Bonaire for a while. They are both fully vaccinated with Pfizer. They have trip insurance and good international medical health insurance. But they would hate to have to cancel the trip due to a positive PCR test. Seems like a positive PCR tests may be quite a bit more likely that a symptomatic case of Covid19. The narrator doesn't have a good feel for the risk. Is it less than 1%?

### End","The narrator is concerned about the risk of a positive PCR test for his upcoming flights. He is concerned that the situation is not fair, as he does not have good information about the risk of a positive PCR test for a funeral.

### End","The situation will likely get worse, since the narrator is considering going on vacation during a period when the rate of new cases is high.

### End","I don't have a good feel for the risk. Is it less than 1%? I am trying to figure out the risk of ending up with a positive PCR for these flights.

### End","The situation is somewhat consistent with external and social norms.  Cheating on an exam is wrong, but cutting a line to get a test is not.  Failing to wear a mask in public is not only wrong, but a crime in some places.  Flying to Bonaire on those dates would be very difficult, but not impossible.  If one has a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the flight, the risk of getting a positive PCR test from Covid-19 is less than 1%.  If one does not have a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the flight, the risk of getting a positive PCR test from Covid-19 is greater than 1%.  The risk of getting a positive PCR test from Covid-19 is greater than 1% for both scenarios.

### End","The narrator is trying to estimate the risk of a positive PCR test from Covid-19 for the two trips.  They are assuming that the following are true:
1. The funeral is in Cleveland County, NC.
2. The vax rate is 40%
3. The narrator and their spouse will be attending the funeral
4. The narrator will be wearing a mask
5. The narrator will be able to get a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the flight on either of the two dates they are considering.

Based on this information, the narrator can estimate the risk of a positive PCR test from Covid-19 for the two trips as follows:
1. The vax rate is 40%
2. The narrator and their spouse will be attending the funeral
3. The narrator will be wearing a mask
4. The narrator will be able to get a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the flight on either of the two dates they are considering.

Based on these assumptions, the risk of a positive PCR test from Covid-19 for the two trips is greater than 1% because the narrator does not have a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the flight on either of the two dates.

I wasn't involved in this situation, so I don't know the full context, but I can share what I do know.  

Steve's workplace was hit hard by a virus a few months ago, and many of his coworkers became sick.  Rather than inform employees, management kept the situation a secret, which blew up in their face and caused significant employee turnover.  

It sounds like this is happening again, and that management is not taking the situation seriously.  Steve is worried that inaction will lead to retaliation, so he is hesitant to talk to management directly.  I recommend that he talk to his coworkers and see if they know anything that he doesn't.  If not, he can report the situation to a regulatory body or a union.  

I hope this helps, and please let me know if I can provide any more information.

I am, however, a traveler, and I've been to many places where it is safe to travel and where it isn't. Based on my experience, I would say that the following are the most important factors in determining whether or not a location is safe to travel to:
1. The quality of the local healthcare system.
2. The safety of the local crime rate.
3. The level of security at the airport.
4. The level of security at the hotel.

If you do attend, you may want to bring a medical mask to shield others from your presence if you are unable to wear one yourself.

Fourth, consider whether you want to bring a gift.

I've been in a similar situation. My brother and sister-in-law are expecting me to come to their gender reveal party. They live in a very rural area and the 200 mi round trip is a bit of a drive for me. I'm also not vaccinated against the diseases that they have, so I don't want to bring that into the house. I've already told them that I can't make it, but they keep pushing for me to come. I've considered getting a lawyer involved, but I don't want to spend a lot of money to make sure I'm not sued.

I'm struggling with the idea of a haircut - and it's definitely needed. I'm vaccinated but my young kids aren't old enough yet.

I don't care about being the only masked individual, but I can't get comfortable with the idea of being stuck in that space with so many maskless people.

### End","I'm struggling with the idea of a haircut - and it's definitely needed. I'm vaccinated but my young kids aren't old enough yet. I was perfectly happy to go to the barbershop when the mask mandates were in effect. I've been to all of the local places scouting them out but nobody is wearing a mask. In a small, enclosed space there are a few barbers, the people getting a haircut and a few people waiting. I don't care about being the only masked individual, but I can't get comfortable with the idea of being stuck in that space with so many maskless people. I realize times have changed and for now, masks aren't required, but that puts me pretty far out of my comfort zone with COVID....and it's been a struggle. I just don't want to bring something home to my kids. Is this just one of those things where you go for it and trust the vaccine will be ok? I keep reading about breakthrough cases with Delta and can't shake it.

Delta is a very popular airline in the United States. They have a very good reputation for their customer service and food. However, they have a very low number of flight attendants. This is a problem because Delta is the only major US airline that does not have a single flight attendant for every seat. Instead, they have a 1:1 ratio, where for every 1 flight attendant, they hire 1 passenger. This means that Delta has the most empty seats of any major US airline.

However, this is not the only problem. Delta has a very high number of people who are not vaccinated. In fact, they have one of the highest rates of people who are not vaccinated among all airlines. This is a problem because Delta has one of the most empty flights, and one of the highest rates of people who are not vaccinated. This means that Delta has one of the highest rates of people who are not protected from contagious diseases.

Delta airlines has a very interesting approach to getting their customers to get vaccinated. They have a program called ""Vaccinate Delta"" where they will give you up to $600 if you get vaccinated. The catch is that you have to use their website to register for the program, and you have to do it within 14 days of getting your flight. So, if you are flying in a month, you might not have enough time to register and get the money.

They also incentivize you by giving you miles for getting vaccinated. For example, if you get vaccinated for $600, you get 600 miles. And if you get vaccinated for $1,000, you get 1,200 miles.

They also have a lot of social media campaigns where they give you a lot of points for liking and following their page.

Overall, their approach is very innovative and I never would have guessed that Delta would motivate more to get vaccinated.

The scale allows the narrator to express their concern without making definitive statements about their level of responsibility.

### End","7. Other people were: Completely responsible

### End","I often hear that COVID could become endemic among the unvaccinated if we don't reach herd immunity through vaccination. However, I think the argument is flawed because it doesn't take into account the role of natural immunity. 
I've heard that natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4.

I believe nerve damage can also occur from a lack of physical activity, such as sitting in a chair all day. I believe the lack of physical activity causes the nerves to become damaged, and the nerves then send pain signals to the brain. I believe the brain then interprets the pain signals as pleasure, and thus the brain learns to associate pleasure with inactivity, and inactivity with pain.

I would like to hear more about the narrator's immune condition, but I don't think it's explained enough to make a judgement.

I think the narrator is being too alarmist about the risk of their husband traveling and bringing the virus back to the family. The narrator says their children are under 12, but doesn't say whether the children are vaccinated or not. If the children are not vaccinated, then the risk of the children getting sick or even a worse case scenario is very real.

I would recommend the narrator talk to a doctor about the risks of not fully vaccinating their children, and weigh the risks of traveling with their husband against the risks of not fully vaccinating their children.

The narrator also expresses concern that her husband would be uncomfortable traveling alone, and that he would be at risk of quarantining from the family after traveling. The narrator's stated goals are to ensure the safety of her children, and to make sure that her family is fully vaccinated before her husband travels alone.
The narrator's concerns are partially valid. It is possible for someone who is fully vaccinated to test positive for COVID-19, even if they have a strong immune response to the vaccine. This is because the vaccine does not provide complete immunity, and some people who receive the vaccine may still be susceptible to infection. However, it is also possible to get COVID-19 even if you are not vaccinated at all, and there is no evidence that the vaccine increases your risk of getting the disease. The narrator's concerns are also valid in the sense that her husband is not comfortable traveling alone, and that her family's small home would make it difficult to quarantine her husband after he traveled. However, the narrator's stated goals are not fully consistent with her concerns. The","7

I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.

Those thoughts fueled my suicidal urges for months last year. It seemed less painful to just die than to wait for a future that didn't seem to ever arrive.

### End","I'm not sure if this answers your question, but I'm from Mexico and I'm here in France to study and I got the Moderna vaccine for my immunity. I'm not sure if you're still in the process of deciding if you want to get the second dose or not, but I'll try to help anyway.

First of all, I don't think you're fully vaccinated yet, since you got only 1 dose. The Moderna vaccine is a mRNA vaccine, which means it's made of mRNA molecules that are injected into your body and then translated into proteins that will generate the immunity. The proteins will be made in your body for a long time, so you need to get 2 doses to be fully vaccinated.

The second thing is that you can mix the Moderna mRNA vaccines. The Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines are made of DNA, which means they are not translated into proteins and they only last for one dose. The Sputnik V and Sinovac vaccines are made of viral particles, so they are translated into proteins and they last for two doses.

So, if you get the 2 doses of the mRNA vaccines, you will have the same immunity as if you got the 2 doses of the DNA vaccines.","7
