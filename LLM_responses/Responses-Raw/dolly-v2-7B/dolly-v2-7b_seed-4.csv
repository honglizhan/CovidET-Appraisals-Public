They cried more and felt sad when people were having fun with friends and family. They didn't have that. They had no close friends but they lost all their distant friends during the pandemic. They've known the therapist for a long time so that's a sad thought, but they feel like he's just giving advice that he's given them before, rather than tailored to their current situation.

I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.

Every health professional that Ive seen regarding it hasnt seemed to think its that much of a big deal as Im medicated and blood work looks fine, but I will be on meds for it for the rest of my life. I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk. However, Im also afraid that the vaccine will cause further autoimmune problems, as the disease I already have is already a lot to deal with especially when I cant find a health professional that knows enough about it to help me.

### End","I don't know why you would mark it as NA. The scale is NA because it is not clear what the scale is.

### End","7/9

The narrator mentions that they are fully vaxed and has been itching to go out again, but is still wary. This suggests that the narrator is a person who is very concerned about getting infected with a virus, and is therefore likely to avoid going out even if there are no restrictions on doing so. This is consistent with the narrator being a person who values health and safety above all else.

However, the narrator also mentions that they go to the movies ""the last few weeks"". This suggests that the narrator is also a person who enjoys going out and is willing to go out even if there are restrictions on doing so. This is inconsistent with the narrator being a person who values health and safety above all else.

Overall, I would say that the narrator is a 7/9 on a scale from 1 to 9, with 1 being ""Situation was: Completely inconsistent"", 5 being ""Neutral"", and 9 being ""Situation was: Completely consistent"".

I now have a whole different perspective on my governments organization. They have a good oiled vaccination machine. They just need more doses. Best part is I was told I could come back for my second dose whenever my relative was scheduled to get Hers. I have a lil arm pain. But its the slightest arm pain when moving it past certain angles. I've noticed that a lil blood drop shows on my vaccination spot (took a shower half an hour later). Is this normal?

The narrator also mentions that they got a blood drop on their vaccination spot, which is a little painful. However, this is not a big deal, and the narrator rates the situation as 7, which is neutral.

NSAIDs are generally considered safe, and are often recommended for people experiencing side effects from vaccines.

The problem is that the narrator is experiencing side effects from the vaccine, and is taking medication to help with those side effects. This is a bad thing, because the medication is dampening their immune response to the vaccine. The narrator's immune system is trying to fight off the virus, but the medication is stopping it from doing so. This means the narrator is at risk of getting sick, which is a bad thing.

The good news is that the medication is not 100% effective. The narrator's body still has some immunity, which means they can still get sick.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic","I don't think I'm responsible for causing the pandemic. I think it's more likely that the pandemic caused us to realize how much we relied on distractions and comforts, and how much we needed to be resilient and adapt to new circumstances.

The situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values. The narrator cares about their health and the health of their family, so they are likely to take steps to protect their family from catching the virus. However, the narrator also cares about being respectful of other people, so they mask up when in public but take off their masks to breath. The mask becomes saturated with sweat, and the narrator has to take off the mask to breath. The mask is not designed to be worn for long periods of time, and the narrator has to take off the mask multiple times per hour.

Options include: 1) Ask a doctor for a prescription, 2) Ask a doctor for advice on how to find a mixed vaccination, or 3) Find a different vaccine, such as Pfizer or Moderna.

### End","7/9

The narrator mentions that they are in the United States, so it is likely that they are a US citizen. As a US citizen, they have the right to choose any vaccine that is FDA approved. In this case, Pfizer and Moderna are FDA approved, so the narrator can choose those.

The pandemic also had a significant impact on the daily lives of people around the world, with many businesses and public services being closed, and many people being laid off or losing their jobs. 

The uncertainty about what is happening in the situation is due to the fact that there is no clear and definitive answer to the origin of the virus.

I don't understand what you mean by ""expect the situation to occur"". The situation is that we are in the beginning of the summer and there is a spike in cases. That is not expected, but it is not completely unexpected either.

### End","The text does not mention the expected timing of the fourth wave. However, it does mention that the media is ""patching up"" the fear of the pandemic. This suggests that the narrator does not expect the fourth wave to occur until sometime in fall.

The text also mentions that the winter of 2020-2021 was ""absolutely terrible and miserable"". This suggests that the narrator is concerned about the winter of 2021-2022 as well. The fourth wave is expected to occur during the fall, which is the beginning of the winter in the Northern hemisphere. The winter of 2021-2022 in the Northern hemisphere is thus expected to be ""absolutely terrible and miserable"".

Therefore, the narrator expects the fourth wave to occur in the fall of 2022.

I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea. Anyone has a similar experience?

We have two reasons for which we are struggling to decide what to do. 

First, it is theoretically possible to get a jab in the UK, but we don't have enough time to get a vaccine passport. This is because there is a risk that either the UK or South Korea won't believe us if we tell them we already got a jab from a certain company.

Second, it is theoretically possible to get a vaccine passport, but it is unlikely that it would be possible to get a vaccine passport from a country that doesn't recognize vaccination abroad. This is because there is a risk that we wouldn't be believed by either the UK or South Korea.

The narrator is worried about being able to attend the wedding of a family member, because of the health anxiety and the fact that the vaccination rates and the wearing of masks are low in the area. The narrator also got the j&j vaccine, which is not 100% effective against delta viruses, so there is a small chance that the vaccine may not be effective against the delta virus of the potential spouse.

The narrator is concerned that the delta virus may cause a serious health issue at the wedding, and is worried that they may not be able to attend the wedding if they get infected.

The narrator is concerned that they may not be able to attend the wedding if they get infected, and that they may miss out on the opportunity to say goodbye to the family member who is getting married.

However, you also said that you are going to a party where there will be 50 people, and that you haven't seen many of the people attending since last year. That seems like a large group to you, but to someone who values personal space and doesn't like large groups, it might seem like a small group. If you go, you will be exposing yourself to a large group of people who might not have your personal values, and you might get sick. If you don't go, you will be missing out on a fun party, but you will also be missing out on potentially getting vaccinated against a serious disease. I recommend going.

Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

The mask I was purchasing was valved, which means it has two separate breathing circuits: one for inhalation, and one for exhalation. The exhalation valve is typically a one-way valve, which allows for air to escape from the mask, but not for air to enter the mask.

The problem with this mask is that the exhalation valve is on the outside of the mask, and can be easily accessed by someone who wants to take a breath. If someone is able to take a breath through the exhalation valve, they can unthread the exhalation valve and replace it with a different valve (e.g. a straw), and then take a breath through the new valve. This means that someone who is able to access the exhalation valve can also take a breath through the exhalation valve, and thereby defeat the purpose of the mask.

I have two solutions to this problem. The first is to purchase a different mask, which has a different type of valve (e.g. a n95 mask).

I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose.

My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts.

### End","The narrator is concerned about the possibility of myocarditis, which is a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the heart muscle. The symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. The concern here is that the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine could cause this condition.

The text doesn't provide enough information to determine whether this is a real risk or not. The text says that the narrator heard reports of this condition after the second dose, but doesn't say anything about the source of the report, the reliability of the source, or whether the report is based on personal experience or is just a rumor.

The text does say that the narrator is very active, which could also put them at risk for this condition. However, the text doesn't say anything about how active the narrator is, or whether they have any specific health conditions that would put them at higher risk.

Based on this limited information, it's unclear whether the narrator's second dose of the Pfizer vaccine poses a risk of myocarditis. The text doesn't provide enough information to determine whether this is a real risk or not.

The situation is somewhat consistent with the personal values of the narrator. The itchiness on the forearms for 2-3 days after vaccination is not out of the ordinary for someone who got the vaccine, and is not related to the vaccine. The risk of having a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine is low, as the narrator had a mild reaction to the first dose, and the vaccine is very safe. There is a very low risk of myocarditis after the second dose of the vaccine, and the narrator is not at risk of having myocarditis.

They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up.

1. When I was younger, I got into a car accident and the other driver was texting and driving. I was in a coma for 6 weeks and now have permanent brain damage. My family says I am a ""miracle"" because I woke up from the coma, but the other driver didn't have to die. They were controlling because they were texting while driving.
2. My family is controlling my life because they are my parents and they are worried about what other people will think.
3. My cousin getting a tattoo is very out of her comfort zone. She is not a professional tattoo artist and she is not vaccinated. She is worried about getting a disease and infecting the professional tattoo artist.
4. My cousin is not masking for the tattoo. She is not wearing gloves, and she is not washing her hands after touching the tattoo equipment. She is not taking the proper precautions to protect herself and the professional tattoo artist.

I also don't want to be limited to eating only soft foods, which limits the types of foods I can eat. I would like to alleviate this feeling, but I don't know how.

### End","7

### End","I think it's fair because it depends on the context. For example, if I am eating and I am feeling nauseous, I think it's fair to wear an anti-nausea mask. But if I am in the dentist's chair and the dentist is drilling my teeth, I don't think it's fair to wear an anti-nausea mask. In that case, I would feel very uncomfortable and I would want the dentist to take care of me.

### End","I'm not sure if I should be more worried or less worried. I mean, I can't breathe without a mask, but I can still breathe without a mask, so I guess I should be less worried. But I feel like I should be more worried, because I can't swallow without a mask, and I can't swallow without a mask, I can't eat without a mask, and I can't drink without a mask, and I can't breathe without a mask, so I'm pretty much dead.

The narrator states that they are a fully vaccinated college student in the US, and that they are relocating to another part of the country for a summer internship. They state that they are seeing friends less frequently since March 2020, and that they are looking forward to getting to spend time with friends when they return to their home state in August. They also state that they are seeing more and more reports that the new Delta variant will require the country as a whole to reimplement mask and social distancing requirements, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. They state that they are feeling increasingly worried that they will come back in August only to find that it has returned to not being safe to see anyone and classes have returned to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since their home state is one of those ""mUh FrEeDoMs"" states with low vaccination rates. They also state that they believe it is reasonable to expect that things will end up needing to go back to being fully socially distanced, as they believe the situation is consistent with what their larger community defines as right or wrong.

It would be useful to know the answer to this question in order to better assess the narrator's level of concern.

### End","The situation is challenging because of the following reasons:
1. The narrator is coming back to a home state that is one of the mUh FrEeDoMs states with low vaccination rates.
2. The situation is also exacerbated by the fact that the narrator is seeing friends less frequently due to social distancing requirements.
3. The narrator is also feeling powerless over the situation, as they are not in a position to change it.

I think it's reasonable to expect things will end up getting worse again because of this variant.  The virus is still out there, and it's likely to be more aggressive and spread more easily now that it's been weakened by the vaccine.  The vaccine only works for a few months, so if you get infected now, you'll be at risk for the next few months, too.  And since the virus is still out there, there's no guarantee that it won't mutate again to become resistant to the vaccine.

The narrator mentions that they are a scientist, so they are likely more concerned with evidence and facts than with personal values. However, they do mention that they are tired of hearing the message that vaccines prevent hospitalization, which they consider to be a personal value.

The narrator also mentions that they are concerned about permanent lung damage from Covid, which they associate with the Delta variant. They do not mention any other variants, so it is unclear if they consider other variants to be more or less damaging.

Overall, the narrator seems to be more concerned with the facts than with their personal values.

The situation is somewhat consistent with external and social norms. The narrator is not allowed to go anywhere, nor does she have a job that requires her to travel. She is also getting a vaccine against her will, which is not common. However, she is not being forced to get the vaccine, she is making her own decision. She is also experiencing side effects, such as a headache and sore arm.

I would recommend getting a hotel room for the night, and if you can't do that, taking a taxi to and from the activities.

On the one hand, I do think that the government could have done more to prepare for this pandemic. For example, they should have done more testing, and they should have done it sooner. And they should have done more to prepare for the economic impact of this pandemic. 
On the other hand, I don't think that other people are completely responsible for causing the situation. I think that it's more the government's fault than other people's fault. For example, I don't think that other people's behavior caused the pandemic. I think that the government's bad policies and bad decisions caused the pandemic.

I'm the one who is trying to make an effort to see my friends, but I'm also the one who is exhausted after hangouts. I feel like I'm not able to leave early or hint strongly enough, and my friends don't seem to understand that I have to do home things after hangouts.

### End","I'm not sure if I can answer this question with any degree of certainty, but I'll try my best. I think the main reason I feel so tired and drained after these hangouts is because I'm not getting enough sleep. I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. Now that I'm trying to make an effort to see my friends, I find myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired. I want to just say no to 90% of these hangouts, but I also feel guilty since I'm leaving and basically set hard limits on in-person hangouts prior to being vaccinated.

### End","I don't know what the narrator is talking about, but I can tell you that I've been feeling similarly tired and drained after hangouts lately. I've been trying to leave early a couple times too, but maybe my hints aren't strong enough, because I find that my friends don't say goodbye until I really emphasize that I have something to do at home. I think I was an outgoing introvert (if there's such a thing) pre-pandemic, but now, getting texts about hanging out just makes me anxious and preemptively tired.

### End","I think the narrator is describing how she feels after hangouts. She is feeling drained and tired after hangouts, and she doesn't know why. She is also preemptively tired and anxious before hangouts. She doesn't know why either. I think the narrator is describing how she feels before and after hangouts, not how the hangouts themselves are affecting her.

It could also be that the narrator is describing a situation from before the pandemic, and is now in control of the situation. For example, they may be describing how they used to be able to handle seeing friends every day, and now they feel exhausted after hanging out with friends. It is also possible that the narrator is not in control of the situation at all, and is describing how they feel after being asked to do a hangout. For example, they may be describing how they feel anxious and tired after being asked to do a hangout, but don't know if they can actually make it through the hangout.

I don't think that I'm at risk of being harmed physically or emotionally by any of these friends, but I do feel like I'm being pressured to hang out more often than I want to.

### End","I think the situation is fair because the narrator has two options for socializing: 1) spend time with friends in person, or 2) do short-term group activities (hangouts) that are less time-consuming. The narrator also has to choose between seeing friends in person or doing hangouts. Overall, the narrator has to make a trade-off between time and energy. The trade-off is fair because the narrator has to make this choice given the current situation.

However, the side effects of the vaccine are very mild and do not differ much from the side effects of the disease itself. Another reason that may convince someone to get the vaccine is the potential to prevent the disease for others. For example, one can get the vaccine to prevent their children from getting measles, so they may get the vaccine for their own children.

I'm not sure if I fully understand your question, but I'll try to provide some context. I'm a big fan of data and I really like to see how things work. I've always been curious about the vaccination rates in different countries, and how they compare to other diseases. I've found some interesting articles that compare the vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in different countries. 
For example, this article shows the vaccination rates for different countries and it also includes some interesting data visualizations.

I hope this helps!

I worked so hard, starting in 2013 when I graduated high school to get to a place where I can work and live on my own.

I will hopefully be at the end of my journey in two years. I'll be living on my own with a job I enjoy. If I haven't found an SO by then, I'll work on that while working on myself. But, will I get to enjoy that future? Climate change, potentially more pandemics, politics, the instability of the world right now, makes me fear I won't be able to. I live in a first world country, I have soo much to be thankful for. Good food, family, good uni. I do what I can to enjoy life, but a lot of my life is still taken up by hard work and anxiety things won't work out. My self confidence was destroyed long ago.

The CDC recommends that people who have been exposed to COVID-19 and are vaccinated with an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine be considered for isolation to prevent the spread of vaccine-derived immunity. This recommendation is based on the premise that the vaccine will not cause enhanced disease or worse. However, the vaccine may not protect the individual from the novel virus, and the novel virus may cause worse disease than the vaccine. Therefore, it is possible that the vaccine could actually make the individual more susceptible to the novel virus.

The narrator is a friend of the person who got COVID-19. The narrator was with the person for 2 days, and the person got sick on the first day that the narrator was with the person. The text does not provide any additional context, so I cannot provide any additional context. However, I can provide some context that may be relevant to the fairness of the situation. The friend is a person of color, and the friend has an autoimmune disease. The friend also got vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, and the friend may be at risk for worse COVID-19 disease outcomes because of the vaccine. Therefore, I would consider the situation to be","The situation is considered fair because the friend got COVID-19 due to the narrator being with the friend for 2 days, and the friend got sick on the first day that the narrator was with the friend.

I wasn't certain about the numbers, but I think I understand what is going on here. The Ohio department of health is reporting the number of people who have received all three doses of the vaccine for the flu, whereas other sources are reporting the number of people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine for the flu. The first number is a percentage of the entire population, whereas the second number is a percentage of the population who have received the vaccine for the flu.

The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older, so the 48% of the population who have received the vaccine for the flu is a percentage of the entire population who are fully vaccinated. The 55% of the population who have received the vaccine for the flu is a percentage of the population who have received at least one dose of the vaccine for the flu.

The flu vaccine is not perfect, and it can cause the flu in a small number of people. However, the flu is a very serious disease, and even a small number of serious cases can have a significant impact on the community.

- The narrator is breaking into pieces because of a dirty stall, and the narrator is trying to avoid dirty places, so the narrator is controlling what is happening by avoiding dirty places.
- The narrator is feeling ashamed of themselves because of a dirty grocery store, and the narrator is trying to avoid dirty places, so the narrator is controlling what is happening by avoiding dirty places.","NA:  I don't know what is controlling what in this situation.

The narrator is not concerned with the risk of future diseases from the vaccines. They are concerned with the risk of the actual disease. The vaccines are not causing the people who get the vaccines to get cancer, so the risk of future vaccines causing cancer is very low. The delta variant is a very serious disease, and the vaccines do not cause people to get better from the delta variant.

### End","I'm not sure if I am more nervous about the risk of the actual disease or the risk of the future vaccines causing cancer.

I'm not a doctor, but I would say it's unlikely that a french kiss would transmit the virus. The virus lives on the surface of your mouth for a few seconds, and then gets sucked into your nasal cavity, where it can be breathed in. The virus is not very strong in your saliva, and the virus on your mouth would have to stick to the surface of your mouth for it to be inhaled into your lungs.

The article points out that even though Delta is spreading, it's not doing so at the same explosive rate as the first and second waves were, and with more people vaccinated, it's more likely to be a more subdued surge at best. That said it did point out how important it is to continue to vaccinations. Still, I do feel a little better knowing this. Fact is, slowed progress or not, we're still vaccinating people. That's good. The more we do this, the better.

I personally don't like how the article frames the choice between Delta and non-Delta as a binary choice between ""slowing the spread"" vs. ""killing animals for food"". I think it's more nuanced than that, and I think it's important to consider the impact of our actions on the environment and other species, and the impact of our inaction on the environment and other species.

First, let's consider the extreme ends of the scale. If the situation was ""Completely unexpected"", then the narrator must have had no idea that the situation would occur. This is unlikely, as the narrator presumably has some understanding of the likelihood of various situations occurring. So this answer is ""NA"".

Next, let's consider the case where the situation was ""Completely expected"". This is the case where the narrator was expecting the situation to occur, but the situation still occurred, and the narrator is not surprised. This is also unlikely, as the narrator presumably expected the situation to occur, but was still surprised by the result. So this answer is ""NA"".

In between these two extremes, there are a range of answers. For example, if the situation was ""Somewhat unexpected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was still surprised by the result. Or if the situation was ""Somewhat expected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was not surprised by the result. Or if the situation was ""Neither expected nor unexpected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was not surprised by the"

My husband and I both fully vaccinated and have been since mid May. I've had a hard time with restrictions being lifted so soon after that because I have a toddler. I was hopeful to be able to maybe start and go do small things like outdoor farmers markets (with my child) or even possibly to go into a store (haven't been since before lockdown).

He hasn't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so we have only been to essential dr appointments. Lately, even things like having maintenance or contractors come into my apartment to fix long standing overdue issues seems too hard and I'm avoiding it because my child is unvaccinated and they technically don't have to wear masks inside my apartment I guess. Other parents seem ok to travel and be out and about with their kids and I am just totally afraid to do the smallest things.

I think I want the situation to change because I want to feel hope. I want to believe that there is a way out of this, and that there is a way to prevent this from happening again. I want to believe that there is a way to save lives and to save our country from further destruction.

But I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I see more and more variants of the virus, and I see more and more states following suit. I see more and more people dying, and I see the country on the brink of a recession. I see the president continue to spread misinformation and spread fear, and I see the country further divided.

I was initially shocked when I saw the reactions to Los Angeles' recent restrictions on mask usage. I had not realized that there were still pockets of the population that had not been vaccinated against the novel virus.

But that's not the surprising part. What's surprising is that, despite the fact that there are pockets of the population that have not been vaccinated, the restrictions have come back.

It seems that, even in a pandemic, some people still want to play the blame game.

I'm not sure if the situation is consistent with my personal values. I do value physical therapy and mask wearing, but I don't like the idea of letting someone wear a mask under their nose. I'm not sure if I should cancel my next appointment or just leave.

### End","I'm torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue.

I'm also going to assume that the situation was not completely expected, as the physical therapy clinic allowed the patient to wear his mask under his nose.

So, I'm going to mark this as ""5"" on the scale.

However, I'm going to mark this as ""9"" on the scale, because the physical therapy clinic is a local clinic, and the narrator is likely to continue to see good progress from her physical therapy treatment.

IMO, that is not acceptable. The results from the trial for kids 5-11 are not going to be until September. Waiting an additional 4 months after that would be absolutely disastrous for both children AND schools. Considering that some schools are not requiring mask mandates I fear the consequences will be stiff. That's why I would prefer for the vaccine to come out sooner than that so that we do not have disasters like this happen. As someone who works with kids, I am very, very concerned about this and do not want to see children continue to be deprived of this vaccine for any longer than necessary.

I went to a movie today. I took occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it","I don't know why the narrator felt responsible for the situation. It could be that they were taking into account factors that I did not consider, such as the fact that they were going to a movie in a highly vaccinated area. It could also be that they were not wearing their masks properly, or that they were not following social distancing guidelines. I don't know why they felt responsible, but I can tell that they were feeling worried and nervous throughout the text.

I think I was mostly responsible for causing the situation by not wearing my mask more often and by not taking my mask off more often when I needed to take a breath. I was also partly responsible for causing the situation by going to a movie in an indoor space where other people weren't masked, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that I live in a highly vaccinated area. I think I put myself in danger by not wearing my mask more often and by not taking my mask off more often when I needed to take a breath.

### End","I'm not sure what the narrator means by ""circumstances beyond anyone's control"". It sounds like the narrator is responsible for taking their mask off and on, and for hearing other people cough or sneeze. So, I would rate the circumstances at 6 or 7, depending on whether I was taking my mask off or not.

### End","I don't think I can answer this question because I don't know the narrator well enough. However, I can tell you that the narrator sounds like they are in a lot of emotional pain. They are talking about feeling scared, being nervous, and getting criticized for taking their mask off. It sounds like they are struggling with their mental health and are looking for advice from others. I would recommend reaching out to a therapist or a support group.

### End","I don't think the narrator was able to control much of anything. I don't know if they were fully able to mask up or not, but they definitely weren't able to mask up and be fully vaccinated at the same time.

I really think we need to do more research on just how many breakthrough cases there are after full vaccination. I know vaccines arent 100% and they never will be, but infection shouldnt be very common either, otherwise we are clearly seeing waning immunity or resistance to variants, and boosters should be looked into. I personally am worried about breakthrough cases, even mild ones, since I dont want to have a loss of taste and smell or even long covid. It has not yet been proven definitively if vaccines prevent long covid should you come into contact with covid 19 after vaccination. I feel like they should have waited to make the vaccines, if they could have, until they knew more about the virus, but we couldn't wait due to dramatic loss of life.

Narrator thought that: Something has been totally lost.

The loss of a loved one is a hard one, and it's natural to feel a bit lost in the aftermath. However, it's important to remember that we can't bring them back, and that the love we have for them still exists. It's also important to remember that we can take steps to help ourselves heal, and that there are many things we can do to help us cope.

One thing you can do is to remember that there are many ways to cope with loss. You can also take steps to help yourself heal, such as spending time with friends and family, exercising, eating well-balanced meals, and finding ways to help you sleep.

If you'd like to talk to someone about how you're feeling, you can always reach out to the Crisis Text Line at 1-800-273-TALK.

The vaccine is designed to stimulate your immune system, and your immune system needs a couple of days to recover from the stress of the vaccine before attacking your own body.

The government also didn't do enough to provide testing and treatment for those who needed it.  

The government and the medical community also downplayed the severity of the pandemic for far too long.  They didn't take the pandemic seriously enough, and they didn't take the recommendations seriously enough.

### End","I recently received an invitation to speak in early September at my former law school. I would be part of a panel, and the event would be one hour and in-person. I would have to travel by car for five to six hours, stay at a hotel overnight, etc. Im very conflicted about what to do I had COVID in April and recently got my second Pfizer shot, so I know my chances of getting reinfected are low. I also believe most of the students/staff will be fully vaccinated. At the same time, Im worried about traveling in general and indoor events, particularly with the Delta variant going around.

### End","I think the situation is fair because everyone has different symptoms, and the only way to know for sure if you have the virus is to get a test.  If you test positive, you have to stay home and isolate, which most people agree is for the good of everyone.  If you don't test positive, you can still get the virus but it doesn't affect your daily life.  I think everyone should follow the guidelines because it's better for everyone.

### End","Because of the way that the scale is worded, it is not clear whether the narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost, or if they simply do not want to go back to the way things were. It is important to note that the scale is worded in a way that implies that there is a choice to be made between the current situation and the situation that was present before the pandemic, but there is not. The current situation is the situation that the narrator is in, and the situation that was present before the pandemic is the situation that the narrator is in now, except with fewer restrictions and better morale. The scale is also not clear about whether the narrator is referring to a situation that is permanent or temporary. It is possible that the narrator is simply expressing a preference for the current situation over the situation that was present before the pandemic, but it is also possible that they are expressing concern that the situation will not improve and that they will be stuck in this situation for the rest of their life.

I live in a small town in the Midwest, and things are pretty much back to normal. And as much as I disliked the rules that were in place, especially those surrounding seeing and being with others and longed for life to get back to normal, Im finding it really hard to get my mind around getting back to normal, especially since quite a few people are still wearing masks (its now highly recommended rather than mandatory in most places, the plexiglass is still there and all the cleaning protocols are still in place). While I am doing things that I would consider normal pre-pandemic (visiting with family, hugging, going to church, etc; still havent done a large scale event or gone to a movie), I am still feeling overwhelmed and weirded out by it all. How do I get over this feeling of feeling unsure of it all? FYI the family members I am visiting with are all fully vaccinated, including myself.

Should I honestly be that concerned about becoming a breakthrough case?

I don't think so. I think you should be concerned about catching a disease, not becoming a ""breakthrough case"" of a disease. Catching a disease is something that is completely within your control, and you can do things like wash your hands a lot, and get vaccinated, and take other precautions to try to prevent it. Becoming a ""breakthrough case"" of a disease is more of a statistical anomaly, and is not something you can control.

The accurate number is 27, not 160 million.

According to this article, the number of states that have been monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations started is around 27.

So is it common for patients to have 60-70% lung saturation? is it something to worry about? thanks and I hope we'll all get over this pandemic as soon as possible

### End","While the situation is not pleasant, I think it is important to note that the dentist who exposed the husband to COVID-19 also tested positive for the virus. This makes it even more concerning that the dentist was not quarantined, and instead went to work and exposed other patients and staff. This is a clear breach of public health protocol. The husband and I are now in self-quarantine, and I am worried about the long-term health implications of this exposure.

The fact that the dentist's office was not able to contain the virus and that the dentist himself became infected is a clear sign that the virus is very contagious and that even brief interactions between people can lead to transmission. The fact that the friend's girlfriend was not feeling well and skipped the happy hour is also a clear sign that the virus is present at the location. The fact that the friend who went to the outdoor brewery also tested positive for COVID-19 is also a clear sign that the virus is present at the location.

Since then, there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected.

### End","Steve's workplace was hit hard, with about 3/4 of the staff of ~150 people getting sick right before the holidays. Rather than inform employees, management/HR did all they could to keep new cases under wraps, so those who were in contact were not made aware of the risk. This obviously blew up in their face and there was no one to work for 2 months. There was never even any formal acknowledgement let alone apology for this incredible lapse in judgement. And Steve doesn't believe there was ever any sort of investigation into the event, if that's a thing. Since then there has been significant turnover, with many new people who presumably have not yet been infected. Well apparently it's happening AGAIN, and the only reason any employees are aware are from sharing info with each other. Admin makes no effort to reach out to those working in proximity to others who may be sick, and are giving no explanation for why certain employees are mysteriously gone, not even to managers of said employees. It's complete lunacy, and Steve has no idea what to do. He fears inaction, if not retaliation if talking directly to management. Is there some organization that he can report this to? To protect himself and other workers? This is in SoCal btw","7

Now myself and colleagues (1000+) have been told that on return, we can come into the office and work, but all teams will be mixed together, and most people will be working from home - probably just a few. This means that I'll be working with a handful of people (who I don't work directly and do different roles completely). What makes me feel worse is that most people don't want to return to work. They have families, friends and good home lives which means not going into an office is no great loss to them. But for me, it *was* my social life. I know I shouldn't be complaining, I have a job, I've not got COVID and I'm surviving. But it makes me depressed and I guess I'm just mourning the loss of the trajectory my life was going pre-COVID.

The narrator also assumed that they didn't have any of the symptoms of the virus, so they didn't need to get the test. However, the second test came back positive, so the narrator had to go get a second test.

I'm struggling with the idea of a haircut - and it's definitely needed. I'm vaccinated but my young kids aren't old enough yet. I was perfectly happy to go to the barbershop when the mask mandates were in effect. I've been to all of the local places scouting them out but nobody is wearing a mask. In a small, enclosed space there are a few barbers, the people getting a haircut and a few people waiting. I don't care about being the only masked individual, but I can't get comfortable with the idea of being stuck in that space with so many maskless people. I realize times have changed and for now, masks aren't required, but that puts me pretty far out of my comfort zone with COVID....and it's been a struggle. I just don't want to bring something home to my kids. Is this just one of those things where you go for it and trust the vaccine will be ok? I keep reading about breakthrough cases with Delta and can't shake it.

Delta airlines has a very interesting take on getting people vaccinated. They have a few different incentives. The first is a bonus for getting your flu shot. The second is a discount for getting your kiddos vaccinated. The third is a status symbol for parents who get their kids vaccinated.

These incentives are interesting because they are not monetary. They are non-monetary. They are not about saving money. They are not about status. They are not about being a good parent. They are not about any of that. They are about helping your community get healthier.

### End","I went to a live wrestling event here in Austin Texas last week. Knew I probably shouldn't go but I knew I was vaccinated so I thought I'd be fine. Fast forward to Sunday evening and im getting some fatigue/body aches and a scratchy throat. I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux & asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up.

### End","I often hear that COVID could become endemic among the unvaccinated if we don't reach herd immunity through vaccination. However, I think the argument is flawed because it doesn't take into account the role of natural immunity. 
I've heard that natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5.

I think a scale that is more objective would be better. For example, a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being ""This situation is completely unfair"", 5 being ""This situation is moderately unfair"", and 10 being ""This situation is extremely unfair"".

I do not believe that this is a valid concern.  First, the immune system is very good at fighting off viruses.  Second, the immune system is designed to protect you from infection, not to protect you from disease.  Third, the immune system is not perfect and there are variants of viruses that the immune system cannot fight off.  Fourth, the immune system does not distinguish between healthy cells and virus infected cells.  Finally, the immune system is designed to protect you from infection, not to provide immunity to disease.  If you have a prior infection with a previous strain of the virus, the immune system will be able to fight off a new variant of the virus.

The pandemic was declared a world health emergency by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 6 May 2020, the pandemic had caused more than 676 million cases and 6.88 million confirmed deaths worldwide, making it one of the deadliest in history. The pandemic had a significant impact on daily life, including the economy, education, and society.

### End","The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's lives around the world. The lockdowns and social distancing measures have caused economic hardships and loss of work, while also limiting people's access to healthcare and other essential services. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on people's mental health, with increased rates of anxiety and depression.

While many people have been impacted in some way by Covid-19, not everyone has been impacted in the same way. Some people have been able to maintain their jobs and access to healthcare, while others have lost their jobs or had their healthcare needs go unmet.

In this context, it is important to consider how people's lives have changed as a result of Covid-19, and how they have been able to cope with the changes. Some people have found new passions or hobbies to fill the time, while others have found new ways to connect with family and friends. Some people have been able to maintain their mental health by engaging in activities that help them relax or manage stress, while others have found new ways to manage their mental health by seeking support from family and friends, or by turning to digital resources.

The situation is very relevant to the narrator's concerns and goals. My husband and I are both double vaccinated but our children are not (all under 12). Unfortunately, my husbands grandmother passed away a couple days ago in another province and he is already talking about traveling for the service. We have been super careful through out the pandemic as I have an immune condition so curbside pick up, remote learning and distancing from our family and friends (with the exception of outdoor visits) has been our norm. While my husband would travel alone, this is a BIG change for us. He seems quite comfortable going-me not so much. I'm concerned about the delta variant. I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option. Any thoughts?

### End","I think the narrator is concerned about the validity of their concerns and the potential risk to their family given that their children are not vaccinated. They also mention that going to visit family is a big change for them, which suggests that they may be considering leaving the province. I think it's valid to be concerned about the delta variant, which is to say that I agree with the narrator's assessment that their children are not adequately protected. I also think it's valid to be concerned about the risk of bringing the virus back with one's own immunity into the house, which is why I agree that my husband should hold off on travel until the whole family is vaccinated.

NA","I feel incredibly conflicted. Im a young, healthy individual who realistically wouldnt suffer extreme effects from COVID. That said, I took the pandemic seriously since March 2020 and have continued to, even after being fully vaccinated as of April 2021. I havent eaten at a restaurant, havent seen friends, wear a mask wherever I go, still treat mail as though it can contain virus (even though theres research to show its unlikely to catch COVID from touching a surface). I know that even if I did get COVID, it would be mild since Im vaccinated. Still, I cant help but continue to be anxious, especially with the probably third wave were entering in the US. I feel like on one hand I should loosen up - see vaccinated friends/family, for example - and accept the risk of getting sick with a mild illness. But the other part of me feels like I just dont want to ever get COVID, period. A lot of my friends and family have been giving me a hard time for not seeing them, so I feel like Im just being crazy/paranoid. This is kind of just me rambling but would like to hear how others are feeling.

I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there.

I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused. Please do let me know your thoughts but be kind and understanding. Thank you.

My mom said that she is scared from the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. She keeps citing the Israeli studies. She got her Moderna shot in March. She said that come September shes going to lie and go to CVS claiming she doesnt have health insurance so she can get a third shot. I think this is morally reprehensible considering children may need those shots by then. Any resources to calm her down would be appreciated.

I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac. I'm considering on registering and taking my ""second dose"" here. Specially if it were Pfizer since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies. My parents say I shouldn't ""risk it"" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected.

I'm Mexican and I'm studying in France. I got vaccinated with Moderna in December and they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know...

I'm a Mexican citizen studying in France.
