I think the narrator is referring to the distant friends not being able to visit the narrator because of the pandemic. I think the narrator is also referring to the therapist not being able to help the narrator because the therapist has told the narrator that he/she can call the therapist if the narrator gets in a very bad way, but the narrator is not expecting the therapist to provide any solution to the problem. I think the reason the narrator feels like the therapist is providing repeated advice is because the therapist has told the narrator the same advice multiple times.

### End","The narrator thought that they needed to exert a large amount of effort to deal with the situation. They were feeling dead inside and doing anything required a huge amount of energy. They cried more and felt sad when people were having fun with friends and family. They didn't have that. They had no close friends but they lost all their distant friends during the pandemic. They've known the therapist for a long time so that's a sad thought, but they feel like he's just giving advice that he's given them before, rather than tailored advice to their current situation.

My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody.

The delta variant is a serious concern for many families. Moderna and other companies are working hard to develop vaccines for this variant, but they are still in early development stages. It is not uncommon for vaccines to be less effective in early development stages. 

It is important to remember that vaccines are not a 100% effective. There is still the risk of infection, and there are still serious side effects from vaccines. However, the delta variant is much more dangerous than other variants, and Moderna is working hard to develop a vaccine for it.

The delta variant is a more aggressive form of the virus that causes the common cold. The moderna vaccine is designed to protect against both the common cold and the more severe delta variant. The moderna vaccine is not approved to protect against the common cold, so if you have received the moderna vaccine for the common cold, you will need a separate vaccine for the common cold. 

Moderna and Pfizer have a partnership to develop a delta vaccine. The delta vaccine is in early stages of development, and there is not enough data to determine whether it will be effective against the common cold.

However, taking an anti-inflammatory can reduce the immune response, which is what the Moderna vaccine is trying to produce. So, I would say the narrator's situation is somewhat fair.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part.

The pandemic was a slow-rolling disaster, with the first cases popping up in China in December 2022. It took until March 2023 for the first cases to be reported in the US, and another two months until the first wave hit Europe. By that point, the damage had been done: The lockdowns that followed were too little, too late, and the damage to people's mental health was already done. People were already struggling to cope with the stress of the lockdowns, and then they had to endure the uncertainty of not knowing if they'd ever get to go back to normal life.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic","I don't know, I'm not the narrator.

### End","I think it is fair that children get vaccinated before going to a gym or other indoor public space. The vaccine is proven to be effective in preventing the disease and is safe. The vaccine is not 100% effective, so there is a small chance that a child will get the disease even with the vaccine. However, the chance of getting the disease from not getting the vaccine is much higher. By getting the vaccine, you are taking a small risk to prevent a much greater risk.

### End","I'm not sure about the Delta variant, but the Pfizer vaccine is pretty effective at preventing the more common types of influenza. So if you're fully vaccinated against the common types, you should be protected from the more severe types of influenza as well.

I don't want to wear a mask, it feels uncomfortable and it's not natural for me to wear one. I don't want to be controlled by other people, I want to be in control of my own life.

### End","The narrator is expressing concern that the county is recommending people wear masks again, even though it was just recommended two weeks ago. The narrator is also expressing concern that the recommendation is not mandatory, which makes the recommendation feel more like a suggestion than a mandate. The narrator is also expressing concern that the recommendation is coming from LA county, which is known to be more liberal than the SF bay area, where the narrator lives. The narrator is also expressing concern that the recommendation is coming from a county that didn't require everyone to wear masks during the pandemic, which makes the recommendation feel like a sign that luck was not on the narrator's side during the pandemic.

Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit."

It is also possible to get a vaccination passport, but it would require a lot of money and effort.

### End","First, I would like to say that I am a South Korean who is now living in the UK. I have been living here for over 5 years now and I have never vaccinated against any diseases. 
I am not a doctor and cannot provide medical advice. However, I can share my personal experience. 
When I was in South Korea, I had to get a jab for the following diseases: Hepatitis A, B, and Typhoid. 
I had to go to a specific clinic to get the jab administered by a nurse. The jab itself only cost around $20. 
I had to make an appointment at least a week in advance. 
The process was very straightforward and did not require any special documents or paperwork. 
I can understand that this might not be the case in the UK, but I believe that it is possible to get a jab in the UK.

The article is about Pfizer's decision to discontinue the development of the Delta variant of their hepatitis C vaccine. The narrator is clearly concerned about the implications of this decision, and the article does a good job of addressing their concerns. However, the article does not make the narrator responsible for causing the situation. The article focuses on the negative consequences of discontinuing the development of the Delta variant, and does not make the narrator responsible for choosing to get vaccinated in the first place.

The article does make the narrator responsible for not being able to do the things they used to be able to do, but not for causing the situation that made this possible. The narrator is responsible for not exercising, for not eating well-balanced meals, and for not avoiding dangerous situations. These are all things that make it possible for someone to get vaccinated and then be unable to do the things they used to be able to do. The article does not make the narrator responsible for causing their own situation.

For example, the article mentions that people who are vaccinated can still do things that are potentially life-threatening to people who are not vaccinated.

You said that you are a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus, and that you always followed your principles. But the situation you described is exactly the opposite: you are going back and forth whether to go or not, because you are afraid of large groups, and because you think that everyone is having a good time because of the virus. That is not careful, that is reckless. You should go to your friend's birthday party.

### End","I don't know why you selected this scale, but I think it's problematic. The scale is not anchored at either end, and the middle point is neutral. For example, if the situation is ""completely unexpected"", then the scale doesn't make sense, because the scale is measuring the extent to which the narrator expected the situation to occur. If the situation is ""completely expected"", then the scale doesn't make sense, because the scale is measuring the extent to which the narrator was disappointed by the situation.

I would suggest using a scale anchored at either end with a neutral point in the middle, for example: ""The situation was: Completely unexpected; I was disappointed; or I was excited"".

Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations.

It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again.

We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns???

### End","The narrator thought that something has been totally lost because they are now experiencing a different reality than the one they were living before the lockdown. They are now experiencing a reality where they can only meet 10 friends privately, where clubs and bars are still closed, where they have to wear an FFP2 mask inside and in a Biergarten, and where herd immunity levels have been reached, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up.

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress. I feel so guilty because my family and friends are all so excited and proud of me but I feel empty, scared and sad all the time. I just wish this never happened.

This is a valid concern, since my father-in-law is older and may not be able to handle the physical strain of the vaccination.

I find myself gagging after a while of having my mask on which is embarrassing and limiting. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice? Is there a way to alleviate this?

There is a way to alleviate this.  I would recommend finding a dentist that you can visit without a mask.  If you can't do that, you can try one of the following options.  

1.  Ask your dentist if they have any special tools or equipment that can help you remove the mask during your visit.  
2.  Bring a handkerchief or other cloth to cover your mouth and nose during your visit.  Your dentist may be able to provide you with a clean cloth.
3.  Ask your dentist if they have any special tools or equipment that you can use at home to help you remove your mask.  
4.  Ask your dentist if they have any advice on how you can alleviate the symptoms of gagging.  For example, they may be able to recommend a different type of mask that doesn't cause gagging.

I'll briefly explain my situation before anything else. I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the Moderna vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like ""i can't, i need to study/work"", ""I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?","9 - Completely expected

First, I attended a film workshop and I was surprised that people didn't wear masks indoors. I did wear a K95 the whole time, but no one else did.

I chose the highest rating because I think it is very relevant to my concerns and goals. I want to get my jab so I don't have to worry about getting exposed. I also want to learn more about similar situations so I can better prepare for the future.

I chose the lowest rating because I think it is not relevant at all. I didn't experience the same situation, so I don't know if I should be concerned. I also don't know if I was exposed, so I don't need to worry about getting the jab.

Hello,

Maybe a bit paranoid but... A friend will fly to visit two days after I got my second shot, and I am wondering how safe it is for me to meet with somebody shortly after getting my last dose? Will the vaccine already protect me at its full potential, or how much will it be? I have read all sorts of articles that say basically something between 30% and 90%??? This person will also get his second shot a few days before but is not as concerned as I am about it. He has contact with people at his job, and is basically going out and traveling again - wearing a mask and distancing ofc. I have been in isolation and wear a mask everywhere I go since the pandemic started. I am mostly concerned by long covid and other diseases that can be triggered by it. Thanks in advance!

### End","I'm a 24 year old female, who had covid back in November 2020. My experience with covid was bad, I got a heart inflammation (myocarditis) and it took me 5 months to recover and feel the same as I did before I got covid. My doctor recommended me to get at least one shot, so thats what I did. Its been 5 days since my biontech/Pfizer shot and i really feel awful. My arm still hurts and has a burning and tingling sensation and Im having headaches everyday since the shot. Today I woke up feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded. I also had chest tightness and went to the hospital where they took my blood and did an ECG and they told me that everything was fine, but the dizziness and the headaches kills me. I also do feel hot but I dont have a fever. I just want this to end and feel good again. Has anyone experienced the same and can anyone tell me if it gets better? Also to the women: has someone noticed changes in their menstrual cycle after getting the vaccine?

I mean, I get that the delta virus is more deadly and that's a valid concern, but the reality is that the vast majority of people who get the delta virus recover fully. The reality is that covid is extremely dangerous, but it's not a death sentence. I mean, I've seen way too many people panic-buy toilet paper and hand sanitizer, and that's just ridiculous. I mean, what if there's a real pandemic and we run out of hand sanitizer? What if there's a real pandemic and we can't get toilet paper because everyone's hoarding it? What if there's a real pandemic and we can't get hand sanitizer because it's too expensive?

I don't know of any examples of people who got the vaccine and then did something else. I think that if someone got the vaccine and then did something else, that would be a sign that they didn't fully understand the implications of getting the vaccine, and that they should get it again.

### End","The symptoms the narrator described seem to be consistent with the symptoms of a common side effect of the MMR vaccine, known as ""encephalopathy,"" which can cause symptoms such as headaches, impaired consciousness, seizures, and movement disorders. The symptoms can last for up to a week after vaccination, and can be permanent. It's important to note that the symptoms can also be caused by other factors, such as a brain tumor or stroke, and so it's not clear from the text whether the symptoms the narrator described are related to the vaccination or not. It's also possible that the symptoms are not related to the vaccination at all, and instead are due to something else the narrator is experiencing, such as stress or a virus.

### End","I don't know why you would want to live life without any fear.  But if you truly want to live life without any fear, you have to accept that there is no way to guarantee no fear.  So you have to decide what type of fear you want to live with.  If you want to live life without any fear of dying young, you need to live a healthy life, eat well, exercise, and not smoke.  If you want to live life without any fear of getting sick, you need to get a good job, live in a good area, and get good healthcare.  If you want to live life without any fear of failing, you need to be realistic about what you are trying to accomplish, and work hard, but also take some time off to relax and recharge.  If you want to live life without any fear of death, you need to accept that you will die, and get over it.  You can't live your life to the fullest if you are constantly worried about your own demise.  So choose what type of fear you want to live your life without.  And then live your life to achieve your goals, but don't let fear stop you from doing what you need to do.

From what I can tell, the narrator was exposed to the virus while spending two days with the person who is now sick. The narrator and the person who is now sick were both vaccinated for the virus. The narrator's vaccine is a ""killed"" vaccine, which means it can prevent the person who is now sick from getting sick. The delta variant of the virus is resistant to the killed vaccine, but not resistant to the person who is now sick. The narrator is at work, where there is a higher concentration of people who are immune to the virus, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. The narrator's employer is allowing the narrator to work from home, but is requiring the narrator to wear a mask while at work. The narrator is worried about the health of the person who is now sick, because the person has an autoimmune disorder, and the person has also recently experienced bruising.

### End","The situation is inconsistent with the external and social norms. Both states are experiencing high transmission rates, and case numbers are still low. The situation is also inconsistent with the internal norms, as both states are vaccinating their populations. The rate of transmission is a function of the population that is immune, and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated. If the proportion of the population that is vaccinated is high, then the rate of transmission will be low. If the proportion of the population that is vaccinated is low, then the rate of transmission will be high. In both states, the proportion of the population that is vaccinated is high. Therefore, the rate of transmission is low.

I think they are expressing this because they are reading about the potential for the vaccination rate to drop below 70% in the coming months, which would be a very sad outcome for them. I think the narrator is expressing that they would prefer to see the vaccination rate hit 70% as a way to prevent this outcome from happening.

I'm not a doctor, but I would say that it is unlikely that she would get infected from a french kiss.

Is it possible, or ""possible"" (meaning something like 0.1% chance of getting it)?

### End","I'm a vegan and I don't eat meat or animal products. I also don't kill animals for food. I think it's possible that the virus could be transmitted through a french kiss, because the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 3 hours, and the mouth is a potentially contaminated surface. However, the chance of transmission is very low, because the virus is typically transmitted through respiratory droplets, which are produced when a person coughs or sneezes. Since I don't cough or sneeze, I'm not at risk of being infected by this virus.

### End","I'm not sure if Friday or Saturday is the right weekend to go visit your girlfriend, as both days are Saturday and Sunday is the holiday. However, if you do go visit her, you risk getting corona from her. It is possible that you could get corona from a french kiss, but it is likely that you will not get corona from a french kiss. The probability of getting corona from a french kiss is estimated to be around 0.1%.

I was initially shocked when I saw the reactions to L.A. being labeled as a ""depressed area"". I have to admit that I was also surprised by the number of people who have not been vaccinated yet. I live in Highland Park, NJ, which is one of the highly vaccinated states, so I don't see the need for a mask mandate. However, I do understand how it feels to live in a region where the virus is not yet under control, and how frustrating it must be to see these restrictions come back. But I also want to remind everyone that this is just a temporary measure, and that we will get our lives back. I hope everyone continues to stay safe and take care of each other.

I walked into the physical therapy room and saw my therapist allowing a patient to wear a mask under his nose.  My first thought was just the usual eye roll and judgements about people who behave this way.  Then I came to terms with the fact that they were treating him and allowing this behavior, which IMO made their mask policy complete BS.  So, here's the thing, I'm vaccinated but I have a medically at-risk kid who is too young to get jabbed.  Delta spread is high in our county and from what I've read, it might be more transmittable even by vaccinated people.  I'm about halfway through my expected treatment and seeing good progress.  I also really like my therapist.  But, honestly I'm feeling like I don't want to step foot back in that place.  I'm torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue?

Waiting an additional 4 months after that would be absolutely disastrous for both children AND schools. Considering that some schools are not requiring mask mandates I fear the consequences will be stiff. That's why I would prefer for the vaccine to come out sooner than that so that we do not have disasters like this happen. As someone who works with kids, I am very, very concerned about this and do not want to see children continue to be deprived of this vaccine for any longer than necessary.

### End","7

### End","The situation is not fair because kids should not have to wait until mid-winter to receive their vaccine. The vaccine is important for the health of the children and the health of the school, so it is unfair to make the children wait until the last possible moment to receive it.

### End","The situation would get better because the vaccine would come out sooner, allowing schools to make decisions about mask mandates sooner, and allowing kids to get the vaccine sooner and not be deprived of it for too long.

### End","I don't know much about the situation you are describing, but I'll take a stab at addressing the issue of expectation.  Based on the text, it sounds like you are expecting the government mandated mask mandate to return to Las Vegas.  While this may be the case, it is not guaranteed.  The text does not state whether the friend that is coming to visit will bring their own mask, or if they will be wearing the mandated masks.  It is also not clear whether the friend that is coming to visit will be staying in a hotel, or if they will be staying with you at your house.  If they are staying at your house, it is possible that they will not bring their own mask, and will instead wear the mandated mask.  If this is the case, then you may experience the situation described above.  If they are staying in a hotel, then it is unlikely that they will bring their own mask, and it is more likely that you will not experience this situation.  However, it is possible that the hotel does not have a mask mandate, and they will need to bring their own mask.  In this case, you will not know whether they will bring their own mask or wear the mandated mask, and you will not know","Based on the provided input, the narrator does not expect the government mandated mask mandate to return to Las Vegas. The friend that is coming to visit is planning on bringing their own mask, and is not planning on wearing the mandated mask.

However, the narrator also acknowledges that there are some situations where their personal values are not aligned with the values of the society they live in, and that is a problem. For example, the narrator is a vegan, but eating out at a restaurant is sometimes necessary for survival, so the narrator is not vegan at that meal.

I also know that there is a coughing person above or next to you, and that it makes you think about COVID-19 immediately. It's such a nasty cough, and it reminds you of COVID-19 immediately. It comes so close this way, although there is a wall between you and the person who is coughing. Luck is a factor, too, because you got your first jab 2 weeks ago, and now you have to wait 3 more weeks until your second shot.

Based on what you've provided, it sounds like you are experiencing both an external and a social norm. The external norm is that you should wait 3 weeks between shots, based on the information you've provided about the vaccine. The social norm is that you should not get a job while you are quarantined, because you are spreading the virus. 
Based on this, it sounds like the situation you are experiencing is consistent with both the external and social norms. You are following the external norm by waiting 3 weeks between shots, and you are following the social norm by staying home to avoid spreading the virus.

I went to a movie today. I took occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I am fully vaccinated, but I WAS still a little scared because there were others in the theater and they were not masked. Even though I had been told again and again I did not need to mask up indoors in NJ, I did anyway because I was scared. Only on occasion did I take it off to breathe a few times, but when I heard some people cough or sneeze, I put it back on to protect myself. It had been a long time since I saw myself in the company of people in an indoor place unmasked. And this is in one of the most highly vaccinated places in NJ. When I got home, one of my neighbors actually laid into me for taking my mask off at times, saying that she would have preferred it if I wore it indoors all the time. I couldn't blame her for being concerned, but I was still left feeling worried by that. I wondered if I had made a mistake in going to see the movie, especially in alternating between taking it off and on. For all I know I could end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it","I don't know why the narrator felt responsible for the situation. It's possible that the other people in the theater were not wearing masks, and therefore the narrator was responsible for not wearing a mask. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully vaccinated, and therefore they were at risk of getting the virus from the other people in the theater. It's also possible that the narrator was not taking their mask off to breathe, and therefore they were at risk of getting the virus through respiratory droplets. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully masked, and therefore they were at risk of getting the virus through contact with the virus. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully vaccinated, and therefore they were at risk of getting the virus from the vaccine. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully vaccinated, and therefore they were at risk of getting the vaccine strain of the virus. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully vaccinated, and therefore they were at risk of getting the pre-vaccine strain of the virus. It's also possible that the narrator was not fully vaccinated, and therefore they were at risk of getting both the vaccine and the pre-vaccine strains of the virus.

### End","I'm not sure if I was fully masked or not, but I do know that I was taking occasional turns taking my mask off and on. I was also fully vaccinated, so I don't think I caught the virus from the vaccine. I do think that I put myself in danger by alternating between taking my mask off and on, and I do worry that I might end up catching the Delta Variant without realizing it.

### End","I'm not sure what the narrator means by ""circumstances beyond anyone's control"". It sounds like the narrator is responsible for taking their mask off and on, and for hearing other people cough or sneeze. So, I would rate the circumstances at least 5 for taking the mask off and on, and 3 for hearing other people cough or sneeze. But, I don't know what the narrator means by ""circumstances beyond anyone's control"" - if they mean ""luck"", ""weather"", or ""other things outside anyone's control"", I don't see how those are circumstances beyond anyone's control.

Thank you for your inquiry. I will share the information that I have gathered with my mother and provide her with the appropriate context.

1. mRNA Changes Your DNA

mRNA is a modified RNA that is used to make a protein in a cell. The mRNA is then transported to the ribosome where it is translated into a protein. The mRNA is then destroyed after the protein is made.

The mRNA is designed to match the sequence of the protein it is going to make, so the body will recognize it as a match and attack it. The body will then attack the cell that made the mRNA, and the cell will die.

The mRNA is designed to be very similar to a natural virus, and the body's immune system will attack it. This causes the mRNA to be destroyed, and the body to remove the cell that made it.

### End","Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states have implemented ""stay-at-home"" orders, which require residents to remain in their homes and limit public gatherings to prevent the spread of the virus. These orders have had a significant impact on daily life, including what people can do in public and how they interact with each other.

While these restrictions have helped slow the spread of the virus, they have also created challenges for some residents, who feel as though they are being forced to stay home against their will. In some cases, this has led to protests and other forms of civil unrest.

While it is important to enforce public health measures to protect public health and safety, it is also important to recognize that these restrictions can create significant stress and anxiety for some people. In some cases, this has manifested as mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

In light of these challenges, it is important to provide residents with as much information as possible about the restrictions and the rationale for them. This can help reduce feelings of uncertainty and fear, while also ensuring that public health and safety are prioritized.

### End","The narrator describes both their external and social norms. They describe cheating on an exam as wrong and cutting a line as rude. They also mention that they watched a Tik Tok video of someone catching a covid breakthrough case, which they believes is concerning.

However, the situation they described is not consistent with either their external or social norms. Cheating on an exam is not wrong, and cutting a line is not rude. In fact, the opposite is true - cutting a line is considered polite. Similarly, catching a covid breakthrough case on a vaccine is not considered a failure of the vaccine, but rather a success.

The narrator should not be overly concerned. The narrator should not go on a plane knowing that the Delta Variant is spreading. Fortunately if I were to get it, my mom and everyone around me is vaccinated, so that helps.

### End","The graphs in Scotland show that the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.

The article says that 27 states have been keeping track of their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations started, and that the total is around 65,000. I don't know how accurate that is, but if all the other states have the same number, then that would make our maximum number 130,000. Then we extrapolate that against the 160 million who have been fully vaccinated, and it seems like 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten breakthrough infections. So it sounds like other people were not at all responsible for causing the situation.

Without this information, it is difficult to determine how the narrator is certain of this number.

### End","7. Situation was: Completely consistent

### End","The article you mentioned talked about how 27 states have been keeping track of the number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations started, and how the total is around 65,000. However, it's important to note that this is not accurate, as there are likely many more states that are not included in this count. Furthermore, it's likely that the number of breakthrough infections in the other 23 states is the same as the 27 states included in this count, so we're actually looking at a maximum of 130,000.

Assuming that all of those other states have the exact same number of breakthrough infections, and extrapolating that against the 160 million who have been fully vaccinated, means that statistically, 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten a breakthrough infection. This is a relief to many, as they had been worried that the vaccinations would cause more harm than good, and were relieved to see that the numbers didn't seem to support that.

Overall, I think that the article was a good read, and it made me feel a lot better about the situation. I had been stressing a lot about the possibility of breakthrough infections, and this article helped put my mind at ease.

### End","The article you shared makes me feel a lot better because it seems like the majority of people who got the vaccine and had breakthrough infections are a minority. However, I think the scale you provided is way off. According to that article, there are only 27 states that have been keeping track of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations started. Assuming all of those states have the exact same number, that means there are only 130,000 people with breakthrough infections out of 160 million who have been vaccinated. That means that statistically, 99.92% of people who have been vaccinated have not gotten a breakthrough infection. That's not fair at all.

However, the people online are not experts on the subject, and they are more likely to be concerned because they've experienced the side effects of the vaccines.

I have been contemplating about getting the vaccine ever since it came out. I was hoping to gain as much insight from other people as I can to ensure that my health and safety isn't compromised. I've always been afraid of vaccines and doctors (I still usually ended up getting them) but then I also am afraid of getting sick so I've been doing my absolute best to stay healthy and unvaccinated until I am sure. The only vaccine that I seem to trust is the Novavax vaccine which is not available to the public in the U.S yet but I was wondering if I should take the risk of getting a different vaccine because I really do want to get back to my normal life. My main concern about these vaccines would have to be the side effects and ingredients listed on them. Majority of my peers tell me they have been experiencing heart problems ever since they got the vaccine which terrifies me and I am also scared for them! I know they say the risk is so small but I don't want to be added to that number. They literally recommended me not to get vaccinated, and then the people online call me an idiot because I am not. As far as I know, the Novavax does not have any severe side effects like the","I'm afraid of getting sick because I'm not vaccinated, and I'm also afraid of getting a vaccine because of the side effects and ingredients listed. I'm also afraid of getting added to the number of people experiencing heart problems ever since they got the vaccine. I don't want to be one of those people.

For example, people who used to go to work, school or a cafe and interact with other people now spend most of their time at home alone.

First, I think it's important to note that the situation the narrator is describing is not his/her responsibility. It's the responsibility of the person who invited him/her to the party. 
Second, I think it's important to distinguish between a ""hotspot"" and a ""Delta spot"". A hotspot is a location where Delta Airlines has a stronger demand for landing slots, and therefore charges higher prices. Delta is not the only airline with this policy, but it is a common example. A Delta spot is a location where Delta Airlines has a weaker demand for landing slots, and therefore charges a lower price. A hotspot is generally considered more expensive, while a Delta spot is generally considered less expensive. 
Third, I think it's important to distinguish between a ""vaccination"" and a ""shot"". A vaccination is an injection of a vaccine that contains small amounts of a disease to train the immune system to fight the disease. A shot is the actual delivery of the vaccine, which may include a needle. A vaccination is generally considered safe, while a shot","4

If they are uncomfortable with the situation, they could also consider not traveling to the party.

### End","I am uncomfortable with the situation because my niece/nephew lives in a Delta hotspot, and I live in a non-Delta hotspot.  I would need to either drive 200 miles round trip every time I want to attend the party, or find a friend or family member that lives closer to the party location.  I don't want to drive 200 miles every time I want to attend the party, and I don't want to ask a friend or family member to drive 200 miles every time I want to attend the party.  I would like to be able to attend the party without having to make such a long drive every time.

The situation is somewhat consistent with the external and social norms. My brother and sister-in-law are doing a gender reveal party, and my niece and nephew are not vaccinated. Delta is one of the worst hotspots in the US, and I've already told them I'll go.

My niece and nephew are not vaccinated because of personal beliefs, not because of the external and social norms.

First, don't let the fear of being an uncle stop you from going. It's an incredible feeling to hold your nephew or niece in your arms for the first time, and it's an experience that you won't forget. I went to my nephew's first birthday party, and it was one of the best days of my life.

Second, don't let the distance stop you from going. I live in Europe, and I still went to my nephew's birthday party. I flew to the US, rented a car, and drove to the party. It took me about 5 hours, but I did it.

Third, don't let the distance stop you from giving gifts. I bought my nephew a train set, and I still went to the party. I bought a gift, flew to the US, and drove to the party. It took me about 5 hours, but I still went.

I'm struggling with the idea of a haircut - and it's definitely needed. I'm vaccinated but my young kids aren't old enough yet. I was perfectly happy to go to the barbershop when the mask mandates were in effect. I've been to all of the local places scouting them out but nobody is wearing a mask. In a small, enclosed space there are a few barbers, the people getting a haircut and a few people waiting. I don't care about being the only masked individual, but I can't get comfortable with the idea of being stuck in that space with so many maskless people. I realize times have changed and for now, masks aren't required, but that puts me pretty far out of my comfort zone with COVID....and it's been a struggle. I just don't want to bring something home to my kids. Is this just one of those things where you go for it and trust the vaccine will be ok?

We cannot blame the unvaccinated for this. The virus was already out there, and they caught it from the vaccinated. The delta virus is a perfect example of how the system failed us. We put too much faith in the system, and it failed us. We need to do more to make sure everyone is vaccinated. We need to make sure everyone is educated on the risks of not being vaccinated, and the benefits of being vaccinated. We need to make sure everyone has access to the vaccines. We need to make sure everyone is wearing masks when they are sick. We need to make sure everyone is following the shelter-in-place guidelines. We need to make sure everyone is getting the recommended amount of food and water. We need to make sure everyone is getting the recommended amount of sleep.

Delta airlines has a very interesting take on getting people vaccinated. They have a few different incentives. The first is a bonus for getting your flu shot. The second is a discount on your next flight if you get your flu shot within the next 30 days. The third is a discount on your next flight if you get your flu shot within the last 6 months.

These incentives are interesting because they are not monetary. They are not even a discount. They are more of a discount on the next flight if you get the flu shot now or a bonus for getting the flu shot later.

This is a very interesting approach to getting people to get vaccinated. It is not monetary. It is not a discount. It is a bonus for getting the flu shot now or a bonus for getting the flu shot later.

Delta airlines has a very interesting program called ""Rewards for Being Respectful"". Essentially, you get rewarded for being considerate to other passengers. For example, you get rewarded for not using your seat for anything but sitting on it, for not using the bathroom too often, for not making too much noise, and so on. 

The program is very successful. People actually participate in the program. They don't want to get rewarded for being considerate, they want to get rewarded for doing the things that are rewarded in the program. 

So, what happens? Yesterdays vaccinations topped 611k. That is more than a 1000 vaccinations over the previous week. And of those people, 345k are getting their first. That is a lot of people getting vaccinated for the first time. 

What do you think? Delta is motivating more people to get vaccinated because they are rewarded for it.

Since J&J and Astra Zeneca were dropped from the vaccine program here and given to a private company, those of us who received them are not on the regular vaccine plan anymore. At least not for this round, nothing has been planned for booster shots yet. So I can't just go and book a different shot. I already am terrified of my dad dying, especially dying after I have not seen him in over a year and a half. I also have elderly grandparents, my grandad is 91, who knows how long he has left?

### End","I often hear that COVID could become endemic among the unvaccinated if we don't reach herd immunity through vaccination. However, I think the argument is flawed because it doesn't take into account the role of natural immunity. 
I've heard that natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5.

The situation is that there is a pandemic, and the narrator is concerned that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.

It seems like they are making a claim about the likelihood of a future event, but they are not giving any evidence to support this claim.

### End","I don't think the situation is completely fair. While it is true that people who are immune to the original strain of the virus may be able to fight off a more dangerous variant, I think it is unfair that those who can't fight off the original strain of the virus are left to suffer. I believe everyone should be able to get a fair shot at immunity, regardless of their ability to fight off the virus.

### End","7/9

The narrator clearly cares about animal welfare and doesn't want to harm animals for food. However, he is still going to bring his daughter to a place where people are eating meat, and potentially expose her to the virus. The narrator also values his job and is worried that he might get fired if he doesn't go into work, but he is also worried about his daughter's health.

The narrator is clearly conflicted between his values and his responsibilities. He should not bring his daughter to a place where people are eating meat, even if it means getting fired. He should not get fired either, because his responsibility is to his daughter. He should not get the vaccine either, because it would expose his daughter to a potentially life-threatening disease.

The narrator is clearly struggling with this conflict, and it is a struggle that many people are currently facing. We can only hope that he will find a way to make the right decision.

Weak lost over 30 pounds. My son still cant eat he is barely trying new things to see what works. My son doesnt want to be vaccinated and we are debating but says if we do he doesnt want to be here. We dont go out and he wants to go to crowded places like games and west gate and Dave n busters. I feel like a horrible mother because I wont let him go, we only go to the parks and those even turn into fights because they want to do more. Please Im not sure what to do at this point, my heart hurts for my children. I have one thats wants to leave but blames me because he has no where to go. And one thats 15 that really just keeps to herself.

I thought he needed to take vitamins because he is young and not taking vitamins can lead to other health issues. I also thought he needed to take other supplements like zinc, magnesium, and vit c.

I don't know if I would call it lying, but I was able to get a Moderna or Pfizer booster for myself and my kids without any trouble. I'll explain how I did it below, but first, let me explain why it's a good idea.

The Moderna or Pfizer booster is a new vaccine that is meant to provide long-term immunity. This is important because the J&J vaccine is known to lose effectiveness over time, and there's no longer a guarantee of protection if you stop using the J&J vaccine. The Moderna or Pfizer booster is meant to provide immunity for the next 10 years, which is a lot longer than the J&J vaccine's effectiveness.

The way to get this booster is to get a vial of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine from a pharmacy, and then have your doctor add the vaccine to your existing J&J vaccine vial. This is because the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine is meant to be given in conjunction with the J&J vaccine.

The process for getting this done is as follows:
1. Go to your doctor's office
2. Tell the doctor that you want to get a Moderna or Pfizer","4/9

### End","The narrator feels incredibly conflicted. On one hand, they are a healthy young individual who does not suffer from underlying health conditions that would make them more susceptible to severe effects from COVID. However, the narrator took the pandemic seriously since March 2020 and have continued to take precautions even after being fully vaccinated as of April 2021. 
On the other hand, the narrator has friends and family who have not taken the pandemic seriously and have continued to go out to restaurants, see friends, and wear masks where appropriate. The narrator feels like they are being judged by their friends and family for taking precautions and not going out to restaurants, seeing friends, and wearing masks. The narrator also feels like they are being judged by the narrator's friends and family for taking precautions and not going out to restaurants, seeing friends, and wearing masks. 
The narrator feels like they are in the middle of a tug of war between their personal values and the current situation. The narrator feels like they should loosen up and see friends and family who have not taken the pandemic seriously, and accept the risk of getting COVID, but the narrator also feels like they just do not want to ever get COVID, period.

Because children may need those shots by then is not a reason. It's a fact. And the narrator is not concerned about the fact. She is concerned about the timing. She is concerned that the Moderna vaccine may lose its efficacy before the next dose is due. She is concerned that she may have to lie to the CVS to get a third shot.
