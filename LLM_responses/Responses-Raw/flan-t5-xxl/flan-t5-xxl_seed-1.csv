They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic.

Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations.

I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option.

The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live.

It certainly is a lot weaker in many countries, but not here. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread while watching the ceremony. The thought of a neverending epidemic and endless pseudo-normalcy hadn't crossed my mind in so long, and it came back today. Those thoughts fueled my suicidal urges for months last year. It seemed less painful to just die than to wait for a future that didn't seem to ever arrive.
