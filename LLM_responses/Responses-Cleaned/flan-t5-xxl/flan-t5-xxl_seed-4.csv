Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures.

It's now clear that vaccines alone are not stopping the spread of this thing and vaccinated people are spreading. That means that in a few weeks this wave will be everywhere. I'm worried about kids who are 12 and below who aren't vaccinated. It will be impossible to have any schools open in the fall unless we risk long covid in kids which would be unimaginable. I'm worried bout breakthrough cases even though they're rare I worry bout older people in my family and I know some immune compromised people who are going to be in trouble regardless. I understand the psychology of not wanting restrictions and lockdowns but it's clear that the pandemic isn't over we're entering a whole new stage of it and I hope that people follow the rules and don't risk their neighbors lives in the coming months due to selfishness and ignorance. I just wanted to say that"

In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps.

According to this the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other 23 states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000.

opclmu,0,I feel like this argument is so futile because shouldnt have this been part of the equation or formula making?

The constraint being that we were never going to convince 100% of the population to get vaxxed?,1,I am worried about our collective societys mental health. My friends that I have spoken to that recently tested positive and have mild symptoms despite being vaccinated are feeling betrayed by the vaccine. I dont think we should be feeling this way. I also understand a big source of anger is that so many unvaccinated people caused this spike.

I've heard of several people testing positive despite being fully vaccinated. I'm especially worried about our kids because they have no protection at this point. How valid are my concerns? Can my husband still catch covid and bring it home to our family? Is there a way to do this safely? Our home is small and the chance of my husband quarantining from us after traveling is impossible. Personally, I would feel much more comfortable if he held off on travel until our whole family was vaccinated but that doesn't appear to be an option.
