o8ejot,0,"I think I am responsible for the situation because I have been spiraling out of control lately on account of the Delta Variant reports, particularly the WHO message. As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before. And for that, I personally think we should stay hopeful, not fearful.

They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic.

COVID causes lung scarring and organ damage even in mild cases. So if vaccines raise the chances of only a ""mild"" breakthrough infection, that doesn't mean we won't come out with no damage. And yet, where are the treatments to prevent this? How are we supposed to live with this when we have no ways to actually make it tolerable? We can't live with coronavirus like any other illness until it truly is like any other illness."

In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time.

The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live.
