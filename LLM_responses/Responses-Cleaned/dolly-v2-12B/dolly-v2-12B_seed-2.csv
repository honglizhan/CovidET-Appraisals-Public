However, I do think that the mask mandate will cause some inconvenience to the Israeli public, and I think the situation will get better as a result.

The mask mandate was a good idea because it will help the Israeli medical establishment flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of right now, Israel has only reached 56% vaccination coverage, and the medical establishment estimates that they need about 70% coverage in order to achieve herd immunity. By requiring all citizens to wear a mask in public, the government is forcing people to get vaccinated, thereby helping to achieve herd immunity faster.

Additionally, the Israeli government has been criticized for being too aggressive in implementing the mask mandate. Many people have been fined for not wearing a mask in public, and police have been enforcing the mask mandate with excessive force. I think the situation will get better as a result of the government's more lax enforcement of the mask mandate.",7,"The situation in Israel right now is consistent with my external and social norms.

Israel imposed their mask mandate despite being one of the most vaccinated countries because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

This will cause a surge in cases that the healthcare system may not be able to handle.

The Delta Variant is a fictional virus that was created in the movie Contagion. The Delta Variant causes a rapid onset of symptoms, leading the infected to believe that they are experiencing the common cold, when in actuality, it is a highly contagious and deadly virus. The Delta Variant was created as a bioterrorism weapon, and as a result, many governments around the world created a vaccine, but never developed a method to eradicate the virus. As a result, the Delta Variant remained as a constant threat, and a bioterrorism threat, for many years.

The challenge was balancing being afraid of the Delta Variant with also wanting to get back to normal life as quickly as possible.",7,"The situation was 7 because I think that the situation was consistent with my personal values as a vegan and not killing animals for food.

The primary reason for this is that the narrator believes that their fate is pre-determined and there is no way to change this. Therefore, they feel that their only option is to accept their fate and put up with their current situation in order to avoid the pain of regretting not doing anything to change their fate.
The narrator also believes that they are unable to emotionally cope because they are afraid of the consequences of the event and don't want to deal with them. For example, the narrator is afraid that if they cancel their birthday party, their friends will stop inviting them to social events, which will make it hard for them to see their friends and potentially lead to social isolation. The narrator is also afraid that if they go to the party, they will get the coronavirus and die, which will make the event a painful experience that they would rather avoid.
The narrator also believes that they are unable to emotionally cope because they are afraid of the emotional pain that will come from distracting themselves from the problem.

This is a good thing because it means that the vaccine is effective, and that people who have been vaccinated do not need to go back into isolation and masking.

They also said that even fully vaxxed people should still go back into masking and social distancing because of the other strains of the virus out there, not just the Delta variant.

Do they mean the still mostly unvaxxed world in general, and should we not worry if were in the US or another country with high vaccination rates?

The WHO said that the situation is FAIR because they are referring to the general unvaxxed world in addition to the US with high vaccination rates. The general unvaxxed world doesn't have the capability to produce enough vaccines to protect the population, so masking and social distancing are required to protect those who have been vaxed. The US has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, so masking and social distancing are not required there. However, the US is not immune to the Delta variant, so it's still necessary to follow the WHO's recommendations.

Some people don't trust the WHO anymore because of their previous stance on vax vs unvax.

At first, the state was relatively less affected compared to other parts of the world. However, as the months passed by, the number of infections started to rise. At this point, the state took drastic measures to control the pandemic. It was recommended that all people wear masks in public places. I was one of those who were exempted from this recommendation. I felt that this was because I had already been through the same situation in the past. However, I later found out that this was not the case.",7,"The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to wear a mask in public.

The recommendation/mandate to wear a mask indoors was kind of discouraging, since the narrator had started to feel like they were wearing a mask everywhere they went since the pandemic started. The recommendation to wear a mask again indoors felt like another restriction, and the narrator didn't see the point in exerting effort to wear a mask when they didn't have to.",7,"The situation was challenging because I had to rely on external sources for information and updates, which put my mental health at risk because I was not getting enough information from myself or my community. At the same time, I was frustrated by the lack of control I felt because I was not able to protect myself or others from COVID-19, and I was worried that the lack of action on the part of governments and leaders was making me feel powerless. I also felt like I was being forced to make decisions that were not necessarily in my best interest, such as wearing a mask when I did not feel like it made sense to me but was required by the government.",7,"I personally value not killing animals for food, so the situation where LA county just recommended vaccinated people wear masks again indoors was completely inconsistent with me.

The UK has mandatory quarantine rules for anyone who has been in Denmark in the last 14 days, and the UK is not exempt from this. The UK has also made it very expensive to test for covid, and the narrator cannot afford to test in Denmark. The UK has not given the narrator any hope of being exempt from the 14 day quarantine, and the narrator thinks this is completely unfair. The UK has also refused to consider the narrator for a covid green list, which the narrator thinks is ridiculous because Denmark is not exempt from the 14 day quarantine. The UK has not given any reason for not considering the narrator for the covid green list, and the narrator thinks this is completely unfair.

The narrator is clearly distraught about a number of different situations that they have experienced in the past year, and are expressing their feelings about how they think they have been unable to control these situations.",0,I don't think this part addresses how other people were controlling the situation. I think this part is about how the narrator thinks Denmark is being unfairly impacted by the covid crisis.,0,"I don't think circumstances were at all controlling. Denmark has been hit harder than most countries, but the infection numbers have doubled for no apparent reason. Denmark has a population of 5.5 million, so the infection rate should be around 150 per million. It's closer to 500. The UK has a population of 65 million and the infection rate is closer to 20. So, the UK has around 5 times the infection rate of Denmark. I don't think luck or weather are controlling this. Denmark has very few cases in prisons, so that's not it either. I think it's the EU's fault. They have a common border with Sweden, which has had very few cases. Sweden is not in the EU, so the UK can trade freely with them. Denmark is in the EU, so they have to check everyone's passport. I think this is why Denmark has been hit harder.",0,I don't think the narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation.,7,"I don't think the narrator was threatened at all. They were clearly very worried about their loved ones, but I don't think they thought that they were in any danger.",0,"I don't think the situation is pleasant at all. The UK has been very hard to get into for many years now, and Denmark is exempt from most of the rules. Denmark has doubled its infection rates, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. The situation is completely unpleasant.",7,"I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming. I know nobody can say magic words to fix things, I just really needed to vent about how it's July 2021 and this is still ongoing for the foreseeable future.",7,"I think the situation is completely consistent with what I wanted, because I wanted the UK to have a low number of cases and Denmark to have a high number of cases. Denmark has had over 200 cases per million people, whereas the UK has had under 20 cases per million people. I'm not sure what the UK's target was, but I'm happy with the result. Denmark has been able to get more resources and expertise from other countries due to its low number of cases, whereas the UK has had to fight for the same resources and expertise due to its high number of cases.",7,"I personally feel that the situation is completely unfair. Denmark has been relatively lucky compared to some other countries, but the difference between Denmark and the UK is that Denmark has not had many cases at all. However, even though Denmark has been lucky, the government has not been able to relax any of the restrictions, and instead Denmark is still following the same rules as the UK. Denmark is not exempt from the same restrictions as the UK, and the rules for getting on the green list are getting more and more strict. The rules for the UK are very different from the EU, and the UK is not part of the EU, so I don't understand why Denmark should have to follow the same rules as the UK. Denmark is a much smaller country than the UK, and Denmark only has 6 million people, while the UK has 65 million people. Denmark has a much higher GDP per capita than the UK, and it is much easier for Denmark to follow the rules than for the UK. Denmark has a much higher GDP than the UK, and Denmark has a much higher population, so it should be much easier for Denmark to follow the rules than for the UK.

I am worried about the stress that mandatory quarantine is causing my grandparents. However, my grandparents are at high risk of getting the virus, so they are in mandatory quarantine anyway.

My dad also has cancer and has to have chemo, so the situation could get better in the long run as well.",7,"The situation is completely inconsistent with what my larger community defines as right or wrong. For example, cheating during an exam is right in my community, but I would rate this situation as a 7 because it's not completely inconsistent.

This situation has been ongoing for the past year, and it has been very overwhelming.",0,NA,8,"I anticipated that this situation would be challenging, because Denmark has one of the highest infection rates in Europe, and I live in a country with low infection rates. I also live in a country with very few exemptions from 10-day quarantines and expensive test packages for the virus, which is very difficult for people like me who are not wealthy to afford. I live in fear that a loved one could get COVID-19, and I am worried that I will never get the chance to see them again. This pandemic has been hard on my family and me, and I do not think the situation is challenging enough for a score of 7.",7,"This situation was somewhat consistent with my personal values, as I am a vegan and I don't kill animals for food. However, I realise that this situation could be more consistent with my personal values, as I don't eat any animal products. However, I don't want to change this situation from 7 to 9, as I don't want to be preachy and I don't want to push my personal values on other people.",8,"I expected Denmark to have a problem because almost every country in Europe has closed its borders. Denmark is not exempt, it has closed its borders and is requiring all visitors to test negative for Covid and have a 10 day quarantine before they can enter the country. I did not expect the UK to be exempt, and I was correct. The UK is the only country in Europe that has not closed its borders, and as such is the only country in Europe that has not required a negative Covid test or mandatory quarantine. I was not expecting Denmark to have such a high number of infections, and I was correct again. Denmark has doubled most countries' infection numbers."
od4pk6,0,NA,7,"I think other people were somewhat responsible for causing the situation. The narrator is clearly concerned about the impact of unvaccinated people on the vaccinated population, and notes that this is a ""shocking change of pace"" considering how well things were going with vaccines. However, the narrator is also concerned that the unvaccinated people are experiencing the Delta Variant, a dangerous and highly contagious disease. The Delta Variant is a dangerous and highly contagious disease that should not be taken lightly, and the fact that it is showing up in unvaccinated populations is very concerning. The narrator seems to think that unvaccinated people are partially to blame for the situation, because they are experiencing the Delta Variant, a dangerous and highly contagious disease.",7,"The narrator thinks that circumstances beyond anyone's control were responsible for causing the situation because the text mentions that the reason for the change in the trend is the unvaccinated communites who are experiencing the Delta Variant. People who live unvaccinated are responsible because they refuse to vaccinate their children, and that is a choice that they make.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to cope with the consequences of the event.

The narrator was glad that New Jersey had not experienced the Delta Variant, because they did not want to go backwards.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation with the vaccines is interesting, but not complicated or dangerous, so they don't think they needed to attend to it further.

However, the narrator does think that the situation with the unvaccinated communities experiencing the Delta Variant is dangerous and complicated, so they think they needed to attend to it further.",0,"I don't think the narrator thought they were able to emotionally cope at all. The NY Times article says that ""the emotional toll has been significant"" and that ""many residents have described feeling helpless and hopeless"". The article also says that ""the grieving process can take years"". The NY Times article is about the Delta variant, not the NY area. The NY area has seen a stable number of cases, and has not seen the kind of explosive growth that the Delta variant experienced. The NY area is also not experiencing the same kind of community spread that the Delta variant experienced. The Delta variant was able to spread much more easily and quickly because it was able to survive in the environment for much longer. The NY area has not seen a spike in cases like the Delta variant, because the vaccines were able to prevent the virus from spreading as easily and quickly. The NY area is not experiencing the same kind of explosive growth because the vaccines were able to prevent the virus from spreading at all. The NY area is not experiencing the same kind of community spread because the vaccines were able to prevent the virus from spreading within communities. The NY area is also experiencing community spread without the kind of explosive growth that the Delta variant experienced because the vaccines were able to prevent the virus from spreading as easily",0,NA,7,"The narrator thinks that other people are controlling the situation because of the context of the passage. The passage is about how the NY Times reported that the government was taking extreme measures to control the spread of COVID-19 because of the Delta Variant. The NY Times is a reputable source, so the narrator thinks that other people are controlling the situation because other people are likely aware of the Delta Variant and its effects, and are taking action to prevent its spread. If the text does not address this question, please mark it as ""NA"".",0,I don't know how to rate the circumstances beyond anyone's control. I think that it's impossible to rate something like that.,7,"The narrator thought they were able to predict to some extent. They believed that they were able to predict that the unvaccinated communites would experience the Delta Variant, and that this would lead to a change in the numbers. They were partially correct, as they were able to predict that the numbers would go down, but not back to where they were before the vaccines were introduced. They thought that this was a reasonable compromise, as they believed that the unvaccinated communites would be able to ""self-isolate"" and keep the numbers stable.",7,"The narrator thinks they are not at all threatened by the change in the number of cases. The change in the number of cases seems to be a positive change, since cases are still low here in New Jersey, and have been relatively stable. The narrator is not threatened at all, because they feel that they are in good hands with the medical professionals and that they are taking the right precautions by getting vaccinated and practicing social distancing.",7,"I think the situation was neutral. The growth of cases in the U.S. has been slower than many other countries, and the number of cases in the U.S. has been relatively stable. However, I do hope that cases go back down again, as I'd hate for us to go backwards.",7,"I am not entirely certain what is happening in the situation. The NY Times article I was reading did not go into much detail about why the change in pace was happening. It simply stated that there had been a change due to the Delta Variant. I am hopeful that the change will be for the better, and that we will not go backwards. However, I am not entirely certain that we won't see a return to the previous trend.",7,I selected 7 because I feel like the narrator of the text was somewhat neutral about the change in the number of cases. They did not express any positive or negative emotion about the change.,7,"I think the situation was fair because the narrator mentioned that cases were stable in the narrator's location. However, I think the situation could have been explained with more context. For example, the text does not mention if the stability was relative to a high number of cases or the number of cases across the entire country. If the latter, then it's possible that cases were stable but still increasing nationally and globally. In addition, the text does not mention if the stability was in comparison to a high number of unvaccinated people, or just in comparison to other countries with similar vaccination rates. If the former, then it's possible that the stability the narrator observed was due to fewer unvaccinated people, but this could also be explained by more widespread vaccination. The text does not mention if the stability was observed in a high population density area or a low population density area. If the former, then it's possible that the stability the narrator observed was due to a very low number of cases, but this could also be explained by a very high population density. The text does not mention if the stability was observed in a low vaccination rate area or a high vaccination rate area. If the former, then it's possible that the stability the narrator observed was due to a very low vaccination",0,"According to the NY Times this has happened. It's a shocking change of pace considering things were going so well with the vaccines. I guess the reason is because of the unvaccinated communites who are experiencing the Delta Variant. Luckily that does not seem to be happening here in NJ. Cases continue to be stable, and we have not seen any of the same kind of explosive growth. But I DO hope that those numbers do go back down again. I'd hate for us to go backwards.

I'd say the situation got worse because things were going so well with the vaccines and now we're getting a new strain of the virus. I'm not sure what the reason is for this new strain to be more aggressive, but I do hope it goes back to being a stable number. I'm not too worried about it getting worse because I don't think the situation will ever get that bad.",7,"The situation is completely inconsistent with what my external and social norms would consider to be right or wrong.

The numbers of cases of Covid-19 have been on a steady incline in New Jersey. We haven't seen any major drops, but we haven't seen any major spikes either. So, it seems like we have stabilized.

I don't want to lose what we have gained as a society.",7,"I think that the situation was familiar because the narrator is from New Jersey, which has one of the highest numbers of unvaccinated children. New Jersey has had a lot of recent news about the rise in unvaccinated children, and the state has taken steps to increase the number of vaccines that children receive. The narrator believes that this is a necessary change because otherwise, the state will see a return of the ""Delta variant"", which is a term that refers to a recent rise in cases of children getting very sick from the flu. The Delta variant did not happen in New Jersey, and the narrator believes that the current situation of stable numbers is a good thing.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation because the situation involved a shocking change of pace and a large amount of uncertainty. The situation also required the narrator to exert a lot of effort in order to keep up to date with the latest news and developments.,7,"This situation was challenging, because I had to make a difficult decision.

The USA has been struggling with a pandemic for over a year, with no end in sight. The situation is likely to get much worse before it gets better, since the USA has one of the worst track records for handling crises of any major country. My country's refusal to get vaccinated is just the latest example of my ""countrymen""'s incompetence and selfishness.

However, I do think that the fact that I've been considering this tattoo for a long time and it is my cousin (professional tattoo artist) are circumstances out of my control. I rate these as 7 out of 9.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation. They believed that the cousin would be able to tattoo the person regardless of the person's vaccination status, so the narrator thought they would be able to predict the outcome. The narrator thought they were able to predict this because the cousin is a professional tattoo artist, and professional tattoo artists do not need to follow vaccination protocols.",7,"The narrator thinks that they are being threatened because they are worried that their tattoo artist is unvaccinated, and that she might be infectious. The narrator is afraid of getting a tattoo and then getting infected with something dangerous, and potentially dying. The narrator thinks that they are being threatened by the risk of getting a tattoo and getting infected with something dangerous.",7,"I think the situation was pleasant, because I've been vaccinated and got a tattoo. It's a little out of my comfort zone, but I'm willing to accept the risk because I think the benefits outweigh the discomfort.",7,"The narrator is clearly uncertain about what is happening in the situation. The situation involves getting a tattoo, and the narrator is debating whether or not to get vaccinated for the tattoo artist. The consequences of not getting vaccinated are not clear to the narrator. The tattoo artist is unvaccinated, but the narrator is still nervous about getting a tattoo done.",7,"I want this tattoo. It has been on my list for a while. I've been debating cancelling but I don't want to. So I'm going to get it but just want to be safe. I've been thinking of this as mostly consistent, because I'm getting this tattoo to fulfill a goal.",7,"I think the situation was fair because the tattoo artist is a professional, and has no fear of getting vaccinated. The narrator is also a professional, and can afford a tattoo artist who is unvaccinated. The only unfair part of the situation is the narrator being nervous about the tattoo artist being unvaccinated.",7,"The situation would get worse because the tattoo artist is unvaccinated, so the risk of infection is higher. The tattoo artist could also accidentally scratch the tattoo artist while tattooing, exposing the client to infection. The risk of infection would also be higher for the client because the tattoo artist's equipment is not sterilized between clients, and the client has not had their immune system trained to recognize and fight off infection from non-vaccinated sources.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with what the larger community defines as right or wrong. Cheating during an exam is wrong, cutting a queue is frowned upon by others.",7,"The narrator thinks something has been lost in the situation because the professional tattoo artist is unvaccinated, and therefore likely unable to provide the level of safety that the narrator is used to in getting a tattoo. The tattoo could potentially go wrong in ways that are irretrievable, or in ways that require a lot of time and money to fix.",7,"The situation of getting a tattoo with a professional tattoo artist is familiar to me, as I have previously considered getting a tattoo, but did not follow through. I am generally comfortable with being out of my comfort zone, but I would not say that this situation is completely familiar to me.",7,"The narrator thought that they needed to exert a moderate amount of effort to deal with this situation. They feel that getting a tattoo requires a professional and that the tattoo artist is unlikely to be vaccinated, so making the process more painful and riskier than usual.",7,This situation was challenging to some extent. I anticipated some struggle in the situation because I wanted to get this tattoo but also knew that my cousin is an unvaccinated professional tattoo artist. I saw this as an opportunity to develop myself and grow.,7,"This situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values. The tattoo artist is a cousin, so the two likely have a personal relationship, and presumably a professional one. The tattoo artist is also unvaccinated, so presumably she doesn't vaccinate herself and her clients against vaccine-preventable diseases. However, the tattoo artist is likely not a vegan, since vegans wouldn't eat animal products, including eggs and dairy. The situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values because they want this tattoo, and they're going to get it done by a professional tattoo artist who doesn't vaccinate herself.",7,"This is completely expected. I've been wanting this tattoo for a while, and my cousin is a professional tattoo artist. She sees so many people get tattooed, and is unvaccinated, so I'm nervous about this, but I don't want to cancel this tattoo because I don't want to miss out on getting this tattoo."

The death of a loved one is often irretrievable because the person who died was important to someone else, and that someone else will now never be the same. The death of a loved one is often irretrievable because the death of a loved one is often unexpected, and the person who died could have been kept safe if they had been able to be seen by a doctor in time.

The narrator's experience is not out of the ordinary, as many others have also reported similar symptoms, such as feeling exhausted after just one social interaction. This fatigue is likely caused by the COVID-19-related sleep deprivation that many people have experienced, as well as the stress that the narrator and others have experienced as a result of the pandemic. The fatigue is also likely exacerbated by the fact that the narrator is an introvert, as introverts tend to have lower levels of dopamine and other feel-good hormones, which can make them feel more tired.

For example, the virus likely spread from animals to humans, and the lack of effective animal testing may have contributed to a lack of preparedness. Additionally, the virus may have been intentionally spread by certain groups for nefarious purposes.

The text also does not specify if the narrator thinks that the COVID-19 cannot be treated now or in the future, so I will assume that the narrator thinks that the COVID-19 cannot be treated now. In both cases, the narrator is right because there are no treatments to prevent or reverse the damage caused by COVID-19 and the text does not specify if the narrator thinks that this is totally irreversible.",7,"I marked this answer as NA because I don't think the situation was familiar to the narrator.

The situation presented a unique challenge to live with coronavirus like any other illness until it truly is like any other illness. With more and more breakthrough infections with Delta, it's clear we need treatments, not just vaccines. Where are the treatments? COVID causes lung scarring and organ damage even in mild cases. So if vaccines raise the chances of only a mild breakthrough infection, that doesn't mean we won't come out with no damage. And yet, where are the treatments to prevent this?

We can't live with coronavirus like any other illness until it truly is like any other illness.",0,"I don't know the personal values of the narrator, so it's not possible for me to rate the consistency of the situation with them.

If both states had high numbers of COVID-19 cases, it would seem that the lockdowns were really working, and that people needed to follow them more closely.

The novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has been a major public health concern for the past several months.

As of 10 a.m. EST on 20 March 2023, there are 1,827,904 cases of COVID-19 and 190,092 confirmed deaths globally.

The novel coronavirus can cause a wide range of symptoms, from a mild cold to more severe illness, such as pneumonia. The WHO has stated that, while the risk of death from COVID-19 is low for healthy adults, the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or lung disease are at a greater risk of serious illness or death.

The world will not ""normalize"" until the pandemic is over, and even then, there is a chance that the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on the narrator's mental health, so the narrator should try to avoid that waiting game and just go out and about with their child as much as they can, even if it is only for a few minutes at a time.",0,I don't know how to answer this question.

The situation is complicated because the risk of getting the virus depends on the type of vaccine that the person has, the time since the person was vaccinated, and whether the person is generally healthy or has another condition that makes them more vulnerable to the virus.

The first situation the narrator is referring to is related to COVID-19. During the pandemic, there were restrictions on testing and wearing a mask while flying. These restrictions were eventually lifted, but only in Canada. Many other countries, such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, continued to have more stringent restrictions on testing and wearing a mask while flying.

The situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with.",8,"The narrator felt challenged in this situation because they were living through a global pandemic that required them to stay at home for months on end. The restrictions put in place by the Trudeau government made it difficult to leave the house, which the narrator saw as an opportunity to stay home and practice self-isolation in order to develop new skills that could be useful in a future career. The restrictions also made it difficult to practice social distancing, which the narrator thought was ridiculous because they were still required to wear a mask when they left the house. The situation was very challenging, but the narrator felt that they could develop new skills by staying home and practicing self-isolation, which would be very useful in the future.",7,"I personally think that the situation is completely consistent with my values, as I believe that staying home is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and to protect the health of Canadians. Wearing a mask on a plane is ridiculous and causes a lot of discomfort and anxiety for passengers, and I don't want to be a party to that. The government should immediately reopen the borders with no restrictions on travel.",8,"I expected the situation to occur to some extent, given that Canada has been criticized for its response to the pandemic. However, I would not have expected it to occur to the extent that it has. I expected the border to be reopened with some restrictions, but not completely open with no restrictions."

The narrator thinks that it's possible to get international travel back to how it was in 2019, by wearing a mask when traveling internationally, but they are unwilling to do so because they don't want to wear a mask inside of museums, airplanes, airports, etc. The narrator thinks that international travel will never be the way it was in 2019 because they will always have to wear a mask when traveling internationally, even when they want to travel without wearing a mask.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation is familiar because they experienced a similar situation two years ago.

They could have done more to prevent the spread of the virus, by wearing masks and keeping a safe distance from others, but also understand that they are not entirely responsible.",7,"I think other people are to blame to some extent for the current situation. The current situation is that the US has a high number of cases, but also a low number of vaccinations. This means that the population as a whole is not immune to the virus, and so the virus can easily spread within the population. The virus then continues to spread to other countries because people that come from countries with low vaccination rates bring the virus to other countries.",7,"I think circumstances beyond anyone's control were responsible for causing the situation because the usa has a high population and a low vaccination rate, which means that the virus can easily spread among people. This is very difficult to control because there's no way to force people to get vaccinated or to wear masks.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to cope with the consequences of the event.

The reason the narrator thought they were able to cope is because they felt like they had a lot of resources and knowledge to be able to cope. The narrator has a lot of money, so they could afford to buy masks and other supplies. They also knew how to make the situation better, because they had watched YouTube videos on how to clean and disinfect surfaces. Additionally, the narrator has a young mind and is able to think quickly and adapt, so they were able to think about how they could cope with the situation.",7,I think the situation is relevant to my concerns and goals because I live in California and the governor just recommended everyone to wear a mask because of the low vaccination rate. I think the situation is not relevant to my concerns and goals because I live in Texas and there is no regulation mandating people to wear a mask.,7,"The narrator thought that they needed to attend to the situation further, as it was either very complicated, dangerous, or interesting. They thought that they needed to attend to it because of how low the vaccination rate was in LA County, and also because of how there were more and more variants of masks, requiring the narrator to be more aware of what was happening. The situation was complicated because there were multiple factors contributing to the narrator feeling hopeless, like how they felt like they were always being forced to wear a mask, and also because they felt like the situation was getting more and more complicated with all of the mask variants. The situation was dangerous because they thought that the situation could lead to a pandemic, and that the masks might not be enough to prevent that. The situation was interesting because the narrator thought that they would learn more about the masks and about the usa by attending to it.",0,"NA, because the text does not address how the narrator thought they were able to emotionally cope with the situation",7,"I thought they were able to control it to an extent. They were able to control how much things changed, but not what actually changed.",0,NA,0,"I don't think circumstances were at all controlling in this case. The narrator seems to think that the situation was out of their control, because they feel hopeless about the state of the world. However, I don't think the circumstances mentioned in the text (like the vaccination rate in California) are out of anyone's control. I give this a 6 because the circumstances mentioned are somewhat controlling, but not completely controlling.",7,The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation. They believed that they were able to predict because they were able to assume that Los Angeles County would mandate masks again and that the vaccination rate in Sacramento County would be low.,7,"The narrator felt threatened because they believed that they were being forced to wear a mask, even though they didn't want to. They believed that if they didn't comply, they would be punished in some way (e.g. have their allowance cut). The text does not mention anything about a physical threat, so I'll mark this as ""NA"".

However, the text does mention that the narrator felt threatened because they believed that they were being forced to wear a mask, even though they didn't want to. This implies that they felt threatened both physically and non-physically. The narrator's belief that they were being forced to wear a mask, even though they didn't want to, made them feel as though they were in danger of something physical (e.g. a dangerous animal nearby), as well as made them feel as though they were in danger of failing an exam. The narrator's belief that they were being forced to wear a mask, even though they didn't want to, made the narrator feel threatened both physically and non-physically.",7,"I think the situation is neutral, because I don't like the idea of wearing a mask all the time, and I don't like the idea of having to change my lifestyle because of the coronavirus. However, I also understand that this is a very new situation and that the benefits probably outweigh the negatives.",7,"I am completely uncertain about what is happening in the situation because I don't know much about US politics. However, I am certain that wearing a mask will not prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I feel hopeless because I believe that the US government's recommendations and mandates regarding masks are causing more harm than good.",7,"I marked this as 7 because the situation was somewhat consistent with what I wanted. The author is frustrated with the state of the world, but still believes that ""there's just gonna be more and more variants"" and that ""this is just never gonna end"". I agree with this sentiment, but I also feel like I need to keep an open mind and be willing to adapt to changing circumstances.",7,"I think the situation is fairly unfair, because even though the narrator is feeling hopeless, they could have taken action to help change the situation. For example, by volunteering at a hospital or donating money to a charity, they could have helped make the situation less hopeless.",7,"The situation is likely to get worse, because the more governments enact drastic measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the more expensive and complicated the situation becomes. As more countries adopt similar measures, the demand for face masks will increase, increasing the price and driving up the complexity of getting hold of them. Additionally, as more countries adopt similar measures, the risk of the virus spreading between countries increases, which could lead to trade wars and increased border restrictions between countries.",7,"The situation is completely inconsistent with my external and social norms. Cheating during an exam is wrong, and cutting a queue is frowned upon by others. In this case, the narrator cut the line in a store, and was subsequently denied service.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the situation is unsustainable, and the outcome is not in their control. The situation is that the US has been unable to control the spread of Covid-19, and the number of infections and deaths continue to rise. The outcome is that more and more variants of face masks are being mandated by local governments, which the narrator thinks is just gonna be more confusion for the public. The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost because they think something has been lost forever, and cannot be retrieved.",7,"I think the situation was familiar because I've experienced something similar before in the past. The narrator is right that there are more and more variants of face masks being recommended and mandated across the US, and this will never end because the US has a low vaccination rate against COVID-19.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation because the situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to address.,7,"The situation is challenging because I feel hopeless and there's just gonna be more and more variants of masks. I feel like there's no solution and it's never gonna end. But on the other hand, I also see an opportunity to develop myself and grow by learning about different types of masks and which type is better for me or my family.",7,"As a vegan, I feel that it is completely inconsistent for animals to be killed for food. However, as I also live in the United States, where there is a lack of government regulation of animal agriculture and the meat industry, I feel that I am neutral on this matter. As a respectful person, I feel that this situation is completely consistent because I don't know the full extent of the situation, but I assume that the animals were killed humanely.",7,I expected the situation to occur to some extent.

In this case, the narrator could be referring to the fact that Covid was caused by a virus, and that other people (e.g. politicians) are not fully responsible for the decisions that were made during the pandemic, because they were influenced by external factors (e.g. the election campaign).

On the other hand, the situation is dangerous, because if the unvaccinated infect others, it could cause a global pandemic that could kill millions.

The text does not provide any clues as to why the narrator thinks they were able to control what was happening in the situation.

The narrator may think they were able to control what was happening in the situation because they were the CDC, and the CDC has a lot of control over things. The CDC is a federal agency responsible for monitoring health and safety issues. The CDC is involved in developing public health policy and providing technical assistance to state and local health departments. The CDC also develops and distributes information on diseases, and produces and disseminates guidance on public health practice.

The CDC may think they were able to control what was happening in the situation because they were trying to prevent the spread of a dangerous virus. The spread of a dangerous virus might seem like a good thing to control, because if it spreads widely enough, it can be contained.

However, controlling the spread of a dangerous virus might not seem like a good thing to control, because the side effects of controlling the spread of a dangerous virus might be worse than the disease being controlled. In this case, the disease being controlled is COVID-19",7,"The selected answer seems a bit extreme.

The delta variant is a blessing in that it will help us all get out of this mess, but a curse because it will hurt the innocent and unvaccinated. In order for the delta variant to be a blessing, we need to get more people vaccinated.

I was expecting some peace when I got the COVID-19 vaccine, and could stop worrying so much about it. However, then the topic of breakthrough infections or immuno-suppressed people came up, I became worried that I might have a compromised immune system. No one seems to have a straight answer on that question, although I do know that studies are working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town, and didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She got the COVID-19, and could pass it on to me, even though I hope neither of us would wind up sick enough to be hospitalized or die. I'm worried about going to Walmart today, as it was like a nightmare, and I was wearing a mask, but I still felt like I was one of the few people there without a mask. I hate having to be scared of the idea that someone's breath could be like a bullet to the brain, only more agonizing."

They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough",7,"I'm not sure what the exact rating is, but I feel like it was a 7.5. The reasons I feel that way are:
1. My two close friends got COVID-19, which was obviously very unfortunate.
2. However, I was fortunate enough to not get it, so that is a relief.
3. I've been following the COVID-19 news closely and have read that it is a very new and dangerous virus, so I was definitely worried about getting it.
4. I've been fully vaccinated for COVID-19, so that was a huge relief.
5. The two close friends that got COVID-19 were very different experiences. One friend had more severe symptoms, such as a high fever and vomiting, while the other friend had less severe symptoms.
6. Overall, I feel like the situation was neutral to me, but I could see how it could be considered pleasant.",7,"I'm not sure what the scale is for, but I'll try to help. I marked 7 because the situation was unclear. The narrator said they read that Covid was ""rare"", but didn't explain what they read or how they knew this.

However, I do think that the situation could have been more detailed in explaining to the narrator how they got infected.",0,"I'm not sure why the situation would get worse or better.

The text does not mention anything about cheating during an exam or cutting a queue. Therefore, I marked this response as ""NA"".",7,"The narrator thinks that something has been lost in the situation. They feel like they just never understand what's happening even though they're constantly reading about it. They feel like they just lost their sense of taste, the ability to taste food. They feel like they just lost their sense of smell, the ability to smell food. They feel like they just lost their sense of hearing, the ability to hear. They feel like they just lost their sense of vision, the ability to see. They feel like they just lost their ability to communicate, as they have to rely on text messages now instead of talking to each other. They feel like they just lost their ability to move around freely, as they have to stay in their homes. They feel like they just lost their ability to work, as they have to stay home as well. They feel like they just lost their social life, as they can't go out and meet other people as they used to. They feel like they just lost their youth, as they're now in their 30s. They feel like they just lost their future, as they can't pursue the things they want to do, like traveling or starting a family. They feel like they just lost their dreams.",7,"I selected a scale of 7 because I felt that this situation was somewhat familiar to me. I've been following the CDC guidelines for the last few months, reading about how Covid is a new virus that has never been seen before and how it could potentially be dangerous, and how it's very important to follow all the guidelines down to every detail. I also read about how Covid was spreading very quickly around the world, and how it was very hard to contain. I've been through this situation before, back in December when Covid first started spreading in China and then around the world. At that time, I was living in China and I had to make a lot of changes to my lifestyle to ensure that I didn't get the virus. I was in China for about 3 months, and then I came back to the US. I was tested multiple times, and I was lucky enough to not get the virus. However, a lot of my friends and family members who were in China at that time got the virus, and some of them even got very seriously ill from it. I was lucky that I didn't get it, but I was very worried that I might get it in the future, because I still had friends and family members who were in China at that",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation,7,"I anticipate this situation to be challenging, but also see an opportunity to develop myself and grow. The situation is challenging because I am trying to understand a complex situation that is rapidly changing, and I feel like I just never understand what is happening. The situation gives me an opportunity to be open to new and different perspectives, and grow as a person by being able to communicate my feelings and experiences to others in a way that is clear and helpful to them.",7,The situation was consistent with the values of the narrator in that the narrator is a vegan and they do not kill animals for food. The situation was also consistent in that the narrator believes that it is rare for people to get COVID-19.,5,"I was expecting the situation to occur around a 5. I had just finished reading about how rare breakthrough cases were, so I was surprised we got the virus."

We've been seeing our immediate family members and close friends who are all vaccinated, but we've stayed away from everyone we know who isn't vaccinated. The issue were having is that the majority of both of our families are anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. One of our friends in our usual group is anti-covid vaccine and anti mask. Most of them, especially the ones that want to see us, acted like covid didn't exist and were out all the time. These people now want to see us, or are being invited to all the functions so the only way to avoid them is to not go.

1. The text mentions that the more people get vaccinated, the faster we will get out of this. Therefore, other people not getting vaccinated contributed to the situation.
2. The text mentions that the Delta variant wave ""thankfully may not be as lengthy"". I assume that the length of the Delta variant wave refers to the amount of time that it takes for the number of cases to go down. Since other people not getting vaccinated contributed to the situation, I assume that the length of the wave is somehow related to the length of time it takes for other people to get vaccinated.
3. The text mentions that the Delta variant wave ""accidentally may not be as damaging as some people fear"". I assume that the damage that the Delta variant wave accidentally refers to is the damage that other people not getting vaccinated contributed to the situation.",0,"I don't know how to answer this question.

In that way, the situation was consistent with what the narrator wanted - fewer deaths and less damage. However, the text does not explain why the narrator is interested in this particular piece of information. It is possible that the narrator is trying to understand why Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 and then crashed, while cases in other countries continued to rise.

In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as lengthy or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy. That's attributed to how much vaccinations we have made. The more people we do this to, the better. I hope I am not giving any false hopes, but this post DID have me intrigued.",7,This situation was completely consistent with my personal values because I am a vegan and I don't kill animals for food.,8,"I was expecting the delta variant to be more damaging than the alpha variant, because of how fast it hits and how it's airborne, whereas alpha variant hits people directly.

I made the decision not to go to the wake because the risk of exposing my mother and other family members to the delta variant was too great.

The risk of transmitting the Delta variant to the narrator is very low, and the narrator has already received the vaccine, so the risk of needing a booster is also very low. However, the risk of exposing the narrator to the Delta variant is much higher, because the narrator has young children who could potentially be harmed by the Delta variant. The Delta variant is a very dangerous virus, and the risk of exposing the narrator to it is much higher than the risk of transmitting the Delta variant to the narrator.

I'll share what I did, since I've been in a similar situation.

I was in a similar situation, where I was an uncle for the first time. My wife and I were planning a gender reveal party for a surprise baby shower, and I was planning on traveling 200 miles to be there for the reveal. However, my wife was pregnant with our first child, and due to complications she was hospitalized for several weeks during the planning of the shower. During this time, the hospital was in a state of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all visitors were required to wear a mask at all times in the hospital.

As a result, I was unable to make it to the hospital in time for the reveal. My wife surprised me with the gender, but I was unable to be there in person to share the news.

However, the narrator also seemed to think that once herd immunity was achieved, COVID-19 would continue to spread uncontrollably among the unvaccinated. The narrator seemed to think that this would lead to a new, progressively worse variant of COVID-19, which would eventually lead to the creation of ""peak fitness"", at which point the cycle would be broken and the pandemic would end. However, the narrator seemed to think that once the pandemic ended, herd immunity would prevent COVID-19 from ever spreading uncontrollably again, which would mean that the unvaccinated would remain susceptible to the new, progressively worse variants of COVID-19, and the cycle would continue indefinitely.",0,I don't think the narrator thinks other people are controlling the situation. The narrator is very worried about the possibility of a scenario like the one described happening.,0,"I don't know how the narrator came to this conclusion, but I do not agree with this assessment. I believe that the situation is in the narrator's control, to an extent. The narrator is worried that if the unvaccinated people get COVID, it will lead to a ""perpetual cycle"" of progressively worse variants, because the unvaccinated people will be a large enough pool that each new variant will be able to spread to everyone. However, the narrator does not explain why the variants would be progressively worse. It could be that each variant is only slightly less effective at infecting humans than the previous one, and that it takes many generations for a new strain to become less effective than the previous one. In that case, the cycle would be more like a rollercoaster than a perpetual cycle. The narrator also does not explain why the variants would be controlled by the unvaccinated people being a large enough pool, rather than by something else. For example, maybe the variants are only slightly less effective at infecting humans than the previous one because they are only infecting humans that have not been vaccinated against the previous variant. In that case, if the unvaccinated people stop getting vaccinated, they would become a smaller and smaller pool of people who have",0,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation. They believed that the situation would eventually reach a point of ""peak fitness"" where it had evolved to optimal survival conditions, and this would break the cycle of producing progressively worse variants.",7,"The narrator thinks that they are being threatened because they don't have herd immunity. Herd immunity is when a large %age of a population has been infected with a disease, such that the disease cannot easily spread through the population. This is because the immune system has seen the disease before, and has built up a memory of how to fight it. Without herd immunity, new strains of the disease can easily spread through the population, because the immune systems of the people who were not immune to the disease have not seen the disease before, and therefore cannot fight it. The narrator thinks that they are being threatened because without herd immunity, the covid-19 virus can easily spread through the population, and cause new variants to emerge. These new variants may be worse than the previous ones, and could reinfect people who have already been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire through the population. The narrator thinks that they are being threatened because this thought makes them worried that if they go the natural immunity route, they will just be stuck in a perpetual cycle of producing worse variants, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.",0,"I don't understand how the narrator came to the conclusion that the situation would be neutral to pleasant. Herd immunity is a desirable outcome, and I don't understand how the possibility of natural immunity could make the situation pleasant.",7,"I am not sure what is missing from my logic here. The thought that a worse variant could emerge and reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them, is a very real one. I think the issue is that I don't know enough about the process to know if this thought is valid, or if it is even a possible scenario. I would be very interested to learn more about this thought process, and I hope that someone more knowledgeable about this can share their knowledge with me.",7,"I am not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, I agree with the narrator that herd immunity is an important goal to strive for. On the other hand, I am worried that the author is overthinking this and making it more complicated than it needs to be. The author seems to think that because herd immunity requires a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, that it will lead to a perpetual cycle of each iteration producing a worse variant. However, this is not the case. First, the author seems to think that the only way to achieve herd immunity is to have a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. This is not true. Herd immunity can also be achieved by having a high percentage of people who are immune to a virus (e.g. through vaccination or previous infection). Second, the author seems to think that because herd immunity requires a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, that it will lead to a perpetual cycle of each iteration producing a worse variant. However, this is not the case. Each iteration will simply lead to a worse variant if the percentage of people who are not immune to that virus is high. The author seems to think that because the current pandemic is getting worse, that it must lead to a worse variant",8,"I think the situation is fair. The argument that the narrator presents to doubt if natural immunity could actually help has not been clearly presented to me. I hear that natural immunity can protect against some variants, but I don't know how common this is, and I haven't seen any evidence that this variant (Delta) is more common than other variants. Given the uncertainty around this argument, I don't think the narrator has presented a strong case to doubt that natural immunity could actually help.",7,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator is worried that the new variant, if it emerges, would be even worse than the last and could reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them.",7,"I don't know what the EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS are either, so I can't rate the consistency of this thought.

The narrator was worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. However, the narrator does think that something irretrievable has been LOST in the situation if they thought that the current situation is the ""best-case scenario"" and that if COVID were to ""peak and decline"" like all previous pandemics, it would lead to a worse outcome than the current situation.",7,"I think the narrator is worried that the situation they described is similar to previous pandemics, which would indicate that they are familiar with this situation. The narrator describes several aspects of the situation that make them think this is the case, such as the progressively worse variants that have emerged over time. The narrator also describes a concern that if they take the route of natural immunity, they will just be stuck in a perpetual cycle of reinfection with each new variant. The narrator finishes the passage by saying that they are worried that this will lead to the same outcome as previous pandemics, which ended after a few years.",7,"The narrator thinks that effort is needed because the situation called for expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with the situation. The situation called for expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with the pandemic, which would likely require a significant amount of effort on the part of the narrator to manage.

The pandemic also likely required significant changes to the way that the narrator's country",7,"The scenario described is very challenging, but I still see an opportunity to develop myself and grow. The thought of a worse variant emerging and reinfecting even those who have had prior infections (Delta) is very concerning, but I also hear that natural immunity can protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated",7,"The narrator believes that the situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values, as long as herd immunity is achieved through vaccination. The narrator believes that herd immunity is a good idea, because it protects those who are unable to be vaccinated (such as infants and the elderly). The narrator is also concerned that if the virus does eventually achieve herd immunity through natural immunity, it may take a long time for the pandemic to end, because each new variant may produce a worse one that can spread more easily among the unvaccinated.",8,"I was surprised by the possibility of a worse variant emerging. I had not considered the possibility of a worse variant emerging, but it makes sense. Even if a virus has natural immunity, if it mutates, it can become more contagious or more virulent. This is why we continue to vaccinate with existing vaccines but also why we continuously monitor new samples of viruses and vaccinate against new variants. I would not have expected this possibility if the narrator had not already mentioned that natural immunity does not protect as well against some variants."

The selected reason is because they were talking about a future event (the start of a new job for the character), and so they thought they were able to predict it.

However, the narrator thought they were able to predict it, so score 7.",7,"I selected 7 because the narrator was threatened by the possibility of failing an exam, and by a physical animal nearby (the pandemic).

They are also aware that this person has a child who is not eligible for vaccination, but don't know why.",7,"I think the situation was moderately consistent with what I wanted, as I was hoping that he would get the vaccine and that we could start to see each other again. However, I was completely unsatisfied with the answer as I was hoping for a higher rating. I think this is because I was comparing my current situation to an ideal situation that I had created in my mind, rather than to an actual situation that I was in.",7,I think the situation is fair because he has been fully vaccinated with Moderna and so have I.

He is due to start again as an employee hopefully next weekend.,7,"I think the situation would get worse, because the employee who cannot be vaccinated is now working with the narrator, and the two of them could potentially pass a disease to each other.",7,"He is an employee, so he should be vaccinated in order to protect his colleagues and the public. He is not allowed to work if he hasn't been fully vaccinated, so he should be vaccinated as soon as possible. However, his daughter is not vaccinated because she is not eligible for vaccination. This situation is completely consistent with the norms that I and the narrator think about this situation.",7,The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because they are unable to reverse the outcome of the situation to get back what was originally present (e.g. the death of a loved one).,7,"I am not sure why this situation was familiar to me, perhaps because I work in the healthcare industry or perhaps because I have children myself. I rate this situation as 7 because I am not sure why this situation was familiar to me.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with this situation because the person in question was due to start working with the company again.,7,"I anticipate this situation to be challenging, because I am used to fully vaccinating my dogs, and now I have to explain to this new hire how to get vaccinated and why he can't get vaccinated yet. I also have to find a new vet who can administer the vaccine in-person instead of over the phone, which I'm not sure if they can do that. I'm also worried that he might not be able to afford the vaccine, and if he gets a job next weekend, he won't have enough time to get fully vaccinated before he starts working.",7,"This situation is completely consistent with my personal values, as I am a vegan and I don't eat meat. I believe in the ethics of not killing animals for food.",7,"I was completely surprised by this situation. I expected him to be fully vaccinated, but not his daughter.

However, I don't know how to rate their response so I'll leave it blank.",0,"I don't know how I feel about other people being completely responsible for the narrator's situation. On one hand, the narrator is clearly struggling with her children's behavior and feelings of guilt over keeping them home. On the other hand, the narrator's son has serious medical issues that may be exacerbated by exposure to other people. I don't know how much of the narrator's guilt is self-imposed, and how much is due to the fact that other people's behavior and attitudes are making it difficult for her to let her children out into the world to get the medical care they need. 

In any case, the narrator's situation is extremely difficult, and I don't blame her for being frustrated and upset. I hope she is able to find the support she needs to get the help she and her children need.",0,"I don’t think circumstances were at all responsible. I believe that the narrator is largely blaming herself. The narrator states that she is a “horrible mother” because she won’t let her son go out. However, the narrator doesn’t explain why she can’t let her son go out. It could be that she doesn’t have enough money to afford to take both her son and herself out, or that she doesn’t feel comfortable taking her son out in public due to the pandemic. The narrator also doesn’t explain why she can’t let her son go out alone. It could be that she doesn’t trust her son to stay in the house alone, or that she doesn’t trust that he will not meet up with other people who are not in the house. The narrator also doesn’t explain why she can’t take him out in the car. It could be that she doesn’t feel comfortable letting her son sit in the car for an extended period of time, or that she doesn’t have a car that can fit both of them and her son’s wheelchair. The narrator also doesn’t explain why she can’t take him out in public, but instead opts to take him to parks and",0,NA,7,The narrator believes that the situation is relevant because they have a 19 year old son who caught Covid-19 in 2020 and has experienced symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss.,7,"I think the narrator thought that they needed to attend to the situation further, because the situation involved long hauling, which is a stressful situation that can cause fatigue. The narrator also thought that the situation was complicated, because they had to make a decision about whether or not to let their son go to crowded places like games and Dave n busters. The situation was also interesting, because the narrator was debating whether or not to vaccinate their son. The narrator thought that they were needed to attend to the situation to make decisions about whether or not to let their son go to crowded places, and to make decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their son.",0,NA,0,"I don't think the narrator thought they were able to control what was happening in the situation.

I think the narrator's son's Covid symptoms were very difficult to live with. I also think the narrator's son and her have different views on getting vaccinated. I think the narrator is torn between her son's wishes not to be at the house and her desire to let him live his life.

I don't think the narrator's son's Covid symptoms were a result of the narrator controlling what happened. I think the Covid symptoms made the narrator's son's life difficult and the narrator had to make a decision between letting her son live his life and letting Covid symptoms control her son's life.",0,"I don’t know the circumstances beyond anyone’s control that were controlling my son and I’s situation. I only know that the Covid-19 virus was controlling our situation.

I think that circumstances beyond anyone’s control were not controlling my son and I’s situation because I don’t believe that the Covid-19 virus was out of our control. I believe that we had control over whether or not we got Covid-19. We chose to live a long-haul travel lifestyle, which put us at a higher risk of getting Covid-19. We could have chosen to live a more traditional lifestyle and avoid long-haul travel, but we chose to live our lives the way we lived them.

I also think that circumstances beyond anyone’s control were not controlling our situation because I believe that the Covid-19 virus was not the only thing that was controlling our situation. I believe that we also had control over whether or not Covid-19 would control our situation. We chose to take preventative measures to avoid getting Covid-19. We continued to live our lives, but we did so with the knowledge that Covid-19 was a possibility.

I believe that the Covid-19",7,"The narrator thought they were able to predict where this situation was going because they caught the virus along with their entire family back in 2020 and had experienced first hand what the symptoms were like. They knew that their son and themselves had severe symptoms like fatigue, pass out fatigue, weakness, weight loss over 30 pounds, and feeling like you are going to pass out. The narrator also knew that their son did not want to be vaccinated and did not want to go to crowded places like games and Dave n busters. The narrator thought that by letting their son stay at home, they were hurting both their son and themselves, because their son was not able to eat or socialize with others, and staying at home did not allow them to see the games or Dave n busters. The narrator thought that they were able to predict where this situation was going because of their first hand experience with the virus.",7,NA,7,"I think the situation was neutral, because although the narrator's son and family experienced serious health complications from the virus, they also experienced serious health complications from long-haul travel. The situation could have been much worse.",7,"I rate the narrator as being 7, because although they clearly understood what was happening in the situation, and its consequences, they were still uncertain about some aspects of it. For example, they clearly understood that their son had Covid, but they weren't completely certain whether their son wanted to leave or stay with them. They also understood that their son couldn't eat, but weren't completely certain whether their son was trying new things to see what worked, or if he was just too afraid to eat.",7,I think the situation is completely consistent with what I want because I want my son to suffer. I want him to feel like he is in hell. I want him to feel like he can't do anything right and that I am always angry with him. I want him to feel so horrible that he will want to leave and blame me for making him stay. I want him to feel so trapped that he will want to escape and I will let him escape. I want him to feel so miserable that he will want to die and I will help him die.,7,"I think the situation is completely fair, my son and I both caught Covid, my son is 19 and at the time was working long hours as a truck driver. This caused him to catch Covid and get very sick. My son has had to live with the fear of getting sick since then, and every time he does get a cold, he fears that it will turn into pneumonia, which is a very serious and sometimes fatal illness. I feel like I am treating my son unfairly by not letting him go out, because I don't want him to get sick, but I also don't want him to live in fear of getting Covid again. I don't want him to have to live in fear for the rest of his life, because that is what will happen if we don't control the pandemic.",0,"I think the situation would get worse because my son and I would fight more, he doesn't want to eat and he loses even more weight, and he still has not gotten over the Covid symptoms of fatigue and being weak. He also doesn't want to get vaccinated and he blames me for not letting him go anywhere. He wants to leave but he has nowhere to go.",7,"The situation was moderately consistent with the narrator's social norms. The narrator's community defines cheating on an exam as wrong, so the fact that their son cheated on an exam is inconsistent with what the narrator thinks is right. The narrator thinks that cutting a queue is frowned upon, so the fact that the son cut a queue to get food is also inconsistent with what the narrator thinks is right. However, the situation may not be completely consistent with the narrator's social norms, as the definition of what is right or wrong can vary between different communities.",7,"The narrator thinks that something has been lost in the situation because they feel like a horrible mother because they are not able to let their children go and live their life. The children that were meant to go out and live their lives are now staying at home because of the pandemic, and the narrator feels like they are holding them back. The children are unable to leave the house because they are afraid of getting Covid again, and the narrator thinks that something has been lost because they are not able to live their lives.",7,"I don't know why this situation was familiar to me, but I believe that I have experienced a similar situation in the past.

I also feel bad that he can't eat and has lost over 30 pounds. I don't know what to do at this point because I don't want to force him to stay home and I don't want him to resent me for it either.,7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with my personal values as a vegan and not killing animals for food. My son is 19 and he caught Covid along with my family. My family has been long hauler, so all of us have been exposed to a lot of air droplets and been in close contact with each other. I feel like I should be more consistent with my personal values as a vegan and not kill animals for food, because I feel that I should practice what I preach. However, I also feel neutral about this part of the situation because I don't want to make a big deal out of a simple situation that many people experience. I don't want to make my son feel like he is disappointing me by not eating animal products. I also don't want to make my son feel like he should be eating animal products to be a good vegan in my eyes. I don't want to make him feel pressured into something that he doesn't want to do.

The situation was that the husband was concerned about his grandmother passing away and wanting to travel to attend the funeral, but also was concerned that the children did not have any form of protection against COVID. The situation was complicated because the husband was concerned that the children would be at risk of getting COVID from him, since he would be traveling alone and the children have no protection. The situation was interesting because of the possibility of the husband catching COVID and bringing it home to the family, and the risk that the husband would need to quarantine from the family if he did catch COVID.",0,"The narrator thought that they were unable to emotionally cope with the event because 1) they were worried about the risk that their husband would bring the virus back to the family, and 2) they were concerned that the children would get the virus and become seriously ill.

The narrator is also concerned that the elderly relative could pass COVID-19 on to the family, which would present a serious risk to the narrator who has an immune condition and so would likely be unable to avoid spreading the virus. The narrator is also worried that the children, who are not vaccinated, would be at serious risk of infection if their father were to get COVID-19 and pass it on to them.

The narrator's concerns about the risk of COVID-19 to the family appear to be well-founded. The elderly relative who will be attending the funeral is at serious risk of infection, and the children are at high risk of infection if their father were to get COVID-19 and pass it on to them. The elderly relative and children will be in close proximity at the funeral, and there is no way for the narrator's husband to avoid spreading the virus to the elderly relative, or for the elderly relative to avoid spreading the virus to the children.",7,"I wanted my husband to be able to travel for the service of his grandmother, because I have an immune condition and we have been staying home as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID.

They didn't specify how much effort, but given that they had just had sex with their girlfriend, it's safe to assume that they thought some effort was needed.",7,"I got my 2nd dose of SINOVAC yesterday (7/22/2021) and met up with my girlfriend a couple of hours later (we had sex).

The situation is also not consistent with the narrator being respectful, since they had sex with their girlfriend, even though they didn't know she tested COVID positive.",7,"I was completely surprised by this news. I expected my Covid test to come back negative, so when it came back positive I was completely caught off guard."
oq4c2z,7,I marked this response as NA because the text does not address the narrator's thoughts on their own responsibility. The text only addresses the narrator's thoughts on how morally reprehensible the situation was.,7,I think other people were somewhat responsible for the situation because my mom only believes vaccines cause immunity to last for 6 months. She has access to the internet and could have found evidence to the contrary.,0,NA,0,"The narrator thought they were unable to cope, as they were morally reprehensible for getting a third shot.",6,"The narrator thinks that their mom's concern about vaccine immunity lasting less than half a year is irrational. They think that the 6-month duration of immunity from a Moderna vaccine is well-established and well-understood, and that it is not a concern for their mom. They think that their mom is being morally reprehensible in her desire to get a third shot. The narrator thinks that their mom's concern is relevant to their concerns and goals because they think that their mom's desire to get a third shot is morally reprehensible and should be discouraged.",7,The narrator thought that their mom needed to attend to the situation because she was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. They thought this was morally reprehensible because children may need those shots by then.,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,"The narrator thinks that circumstances beyond anyone's control are controlling her mom's decision to get a third shot. However, the text does not provide evidence of circumstances beyond anyone's control being controlling. The closest the text comes to addressing this question is the following sentence: ""Even though I tried to convince her that the Israeli studies are flawed, she is still convinced that the delta variant is dangerous and that the immunity only lasts 6 months"". However, this sentence does not provide evidence that the circumstances were controlling, only that the narrator tried to convince her mom of something and did not succeed. The circumstances may be out of the narrator's control, but the text does not indicate that they are controlling the mom's decision to get a third shot.",0,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next. They based this on the assumption that the mom was concerned about the delta variant and was going to do whatever she could to avoid getting a delta variant vaccine. The delta variant vaccine is for a different type of influenza, so the mom was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasted 6 months. The mom got her moderna shot in March. Come September, the mom was going to lie and go to CVS claiming she didn't have health insurance so she could get a third shot. The narrator thought this was morally reprehensible, considering that children may need those shots by then. The narrator thought this was able to predict what was going to happen next.",0,NA,7,"I think the situation was neutral, because I don't think the narrator's mom's concerns about the duration of vaccine immunity were justified. The 6 month duration of immunity that the Israeli studies refer to is for laboratory-developed vaccines, which are not yet approved for use in the United States. The FDA has not approved any vaccines for a duration of less than two years, and the only vaccines approved for a duration of less than five years are vaccines for influenza and meningococcal disease. Furthermore, the studies the mom was citing were about the general population, not about people who received a moderna vaccine. Finally, the mom was being immoral by lying to get a third shot, and that does not seem like a situation that would be pleasant or enjoyable.",7,"I am not sure if the narrator is convinced about what is happening based on the provided text. However, I can see that the narrator is worried about their mother's decision to get a third shot. The text does not provide enough information to determine if the mother is convinced or not. I would give the text a 7 out of 9 on the Certain scale.",7,I marked this as 7 because the situation was consistent with what the narrator wanted. The narrator is convinced that their mom is scared from the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator is convinced that their mom is morally reprehensible for trying to get a third shot by September. The Moderna shot the narrator's mom got in March is the only shot the narrator's mom has received so far. The narrator believes their mom is morally reprehensible for lying about not having health insurance in order to get a third shot.,7,"I think the situation is completely unfair. My mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity from vaccines is not legitimate and that the delta virus can live in the body for longer. There is no evidence to support this claim and it is very likely that she has just been exposed to misinformation from a variety of sources, including anti-vax groups on Facebook. Furthermore, the Israeli studies she is citing are not evidence-based and have been debunked by actual experts. I think it is morally reprehensible for her to try and get her kids vaccinated a third time.",7,"I think the situation would get neutral, because the narrator's mom is convinced that delta variant immunity only lasts 6 months, and so she will claim to get a third shot in September, even though she got her Moderna shot in March. However, the third shot is probably the monovalent vaccine against COVID-19, which is still under development, and so the immunity won't last as long as the immunity from the Moderna shot.",7,"The situation was somewhat consistent with the external and social norms. Moral reprehensibility is difficult to measure, so I'm going to leave this section blank.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity period of the vaccine has expired, and is trying to get a 3rd shot. The mom is not only endangering her own health by lying to get a 3rd shot, but is also endangering the health of her child, because the 3rd shot is for different diseases than the 2 previous shots, and thus the child is now at greater risk of getting sick. The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the mom is endangering the health of her and her child.",0,"I think the situation was not familiar to the narrator because they did not experience this situation before. The situation is that the narrator's mother is scared of the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The mother is convinced that the Israeli studies are relevant and cites them as evidence. The mother got her Moderna shot in March. The narrator thinks that come September the mother is going to lie and go to CVS claiming she does not have health insurance so she can get a third shot.

The narrator thinks this is morally reprehensible because children may need those shots by then.,0,NA,0,"I think the situation is completely inconsistent with the values of being a vegan and not killing animals for food. However, I think it is completely consistent with the value of being a respectful person.",8,"I expected my mom to be scared of the delta variant. The delta variant is a very rare strain of the flu, and it's mutations are what cause the flu to become more dangerous and more difficult to treat. The mutations also make the flu much more deadly. The Israeli studies my mom was citing are about the delta variant. The studies show that the delta variant has a much higher mortality rate than other strains of the flu. My mom is correct that the immunity from the delta variant only lasts 6 months, but that immunity is from a much more dangerous flu, and the mutations can cause the body to develop immunity to the delta variant and other strains of the flu at the same time. I think my mom's plan of lying to get a third shot in September is also completely expected. She is correct that people's immunity to the delta variant only lasts 6 months, but the immunity to other strains of the flu does last much longer. My mom is morally reprehensible for wanting to get a third shot, but I don't think it's surprising given her current beliefs."

The narrator is studying in France, and they received only one vaccination dose because they had covid in December. This made the narrator concerned about whether or not they were fully vaccinated.

It could be that he was overestimating how much other people knew or understood about the situation, or he could have genuinely thought that other people were controlling him because he was worried about the consequences of his actions on his girlfriend's health.

In any case, it's not a good idea to put too much trust in other people.

The narrator got 1 dose of the mRNA vaccine because of covid exposure in December, even though most countries allow for 2 doses. The decision to only count one dose of the mRNA vaccine is not based on any scientific evidence, and is purely based on France counting the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. The decision to only allow one dose of the mRNA vaccine leaves the narrator concerned about getting a second dose, since mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies.",0,I don't understand what this question is asking.

The uncertainty was whether or not the second dose of the mRNA vaccine would be effective given that the first dose was received in December, during the pandemic. The risk taking behavior that the narrator was assessing was whether or not to take a risk and be close to their girlfriend, who has special care protocols to avoid getting infected. The risk was associated with the possibility of infection, which the narrator's girlfriend was susceptible to, and the special care protocols were likely insufficient to prevent infection. The risk taking behavior was challenging because of the uncertainty of the outcome, but also because of the significant potential negative consequences if the risk turned out to be incorrect. The narrator anticipated a struggle with this situation, because it required them to consider both the positive and negative outcomes of their risk taking behavior.",7,7,0,"I expected the situation to occur, as I am a Mexican citizen studying in France."
