I think circumstances were completely responsible for causing the situation. The rest of the CA fields got to enjoy the benefits of new discoveries and innovations, while we were left behind to stagnate in old, ineffective, and potentially harmful methods. New discoveries and innovations are what drive science forward, and by not applying those to our practices, we're simply letting time work against us.

I also think that luck was responsible for causing the situation. If we were luckier with the timing of the pandemic, we might have been able to adopt and benefit from new discoveries and innovations earlier on.

Weather was also a possible cause. If the weather was warmer and more humid, the virus could have spread more easily and quickly, and the pandemic could have spread more broadly and more quickly.

Of course, I understand that not everyone wants to get vaccinated for philosophical reasons, but there are also many people who are too afraid or who don't know how to get the vaccination. This is a global pandemic and it's not logical to keep being afraid and to not take any preventive measure.

If they don't want to take responsibility, that's their problem.",0,"The narrator is frustrated with the state of the world, and believes that circumstances beyond anyone's control are responsible.

However, they think that the anti-vaxxers are being stubborn and choosing not to get vaccinated, which is frustrating to them because they think that will prolong the pandemic.

The situation is interesting because it's a pandemic, and the narrator is frustrated that some people are choosing to not get vaccinated and thus prolong the pandemic.",0,"I am not sure how I would rate my emotional coping ability on this scale. I am frustrated by the anti-vaxxers, but I don't let it affect me too much because I know that the pandemic will eventually end and they will have to get vaccinated.

They thought that by getting vaccinated themselves they would be helping to stop the pandemic from lasting forever.",7,"The narrator seems to think that other people are controlling what is happening to him, but is not clear about how much he thinks other people are controlling. The text does not provide enough information to rate the extent to which the narrator thinks other people are controlling.

It's enough to make me believe the pandemic will last forever."" The word ""they"" is likely a reference to anti-vaxxers, and the word ""wisepmard"" suggests that the narrator thinks they are wise enough to take the vaccine. The word ""mandatory"" also suggests that the narrator thinks the vaccine is mandatory.

However, the text also provides evidence that the narrator thinks other people are not controlling: ""Of course, rationally speaking it isn't true, but it IS hard to keep being hopeful.""

The narrator is hoping that the information will eventually be found and believed by the anti-vaxxers, but because of their stubbornness, the information has been lost for good.",7,"The narrator is frustrated with anti-vaxxers who are choosing to not get vaccinated, leading to the ongoing pandemic in the United States. The narrator believes that the situation is familiar because they seem to be experiencing the same thing from previous experiences in their past.",7,The narrator thinks that very much effort is needed to deal with anti-vaxxers.,7,"The situation was challenging because I was hoping the anti-vaxxers would wise up and realize the pandemic was bad for their health and for society as a whole, and enough of them would take the vaccine to make a difference.

The answer is that the narrator is nervous about getting the second shot at the wrong time. The reason the narrator is nervous is that Iceland has stopped requiring people to get their second shot at a specific time. The reason Iceland has stopped requiring people to get their second shot is because the second shot decreases the effectiveness of the first shot.

I was also worried that the new city might not have enough doctors who could take care of me, and that I might get sick without anyone to take care of me.

The WHO said this because the Delta variant is a new, dangerous, and highly contagious strain of the virus that is difficult to protect against with vaccines. The Delta variant first appeared in South Korea, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. The WHO believes that South Korea's high vaccination rates contributed to the low number of cases there. However, because many countries have not yet implemented widespread vaccination, the Delta variant has the potential to cause a lot of harm.

The WHO has not updated their website to reflect changes in the COVID-19 vaccine. It is possible that they are referring to the changes in the manufacturing of the COVID-19 vaccine, which include using a process called ""Delta-vax"" to reduce the amount of the virus in the vaccine. Delta-vax is a change to the manufacturing process, and is not a change to the virus itself. Therefore, people who are fully vaxxed according to the former manufacturing process might not be fully vaxxed according to the new manufacturing process.

On the other hand, the WHO has stated that ""most people"" who are vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine will be fully vaxxed. This is because the current COVID-19 vaccines only cover four of the six strains of the virus. The WHO has stated that they are working on developing a COVID-19 vaccine that covers all six strains, and that this vaccine will be available ""in the coming months"".

Because of this discrepancy, it is unclear what the WHO means by ""fully vaxxed"". The situation is challenging because people are questioning the WHO's ability to communicate",7,"I believe that it is always important to follow the recommendations of public health experts, especially when they tell you to take actions that you might not have taken before. I also think that it is important to trust the WHO, since they have a lot of experience in this field and they are neutral.",8,"The WHO said that even fully vaxxed people need to go back to masking and social distancing because of the Delta variant. This variant was created by a genetic modification that makes the virus more contagious, but less fatal. The WHO said that this is a ""major concern"" and that more research is needed.

Do they mean the still mostly unvaxxed world in general, and should we not worry if were in the US or another country with high vaccination rates?

I don't know if they meant the still mostly unvaxxed world in general, but I think they should worry if they are in the US or another country with high vaccination rates. The WHO has not changed its recommendations, and is still recommending that everyone follow social distancing and masking guidelines.

Also, heard some people don't trust the WHO anymore?

I don't know why people don't trust the WHO anymore."

Because unlike other countries that had rigorous mask mandates, the Czech Republic had lifted all mask mandates by the time the fifth wave hit.

They didn't even take the basic measures such as wearing face masks or keeping a certain distance from others. As a result, the pandemic spread much further and faster than expected. At the same time, I think other people are not responsible for the current situation, because the situation is much more complicated than just the pandemic. For example, the climate crisis and the emissions of most countries caused by the lockdowns led to the situation getting much worse.

I had to force myself to go out to bars and clubs, and force myself to talk to strangers. I had to force myself to interact with people I didn't know, and force myself to talk to people I didn't know. I had to force myself to talk to people I didn't know very well, because I didn't want to talk to them if I couldn't maintain a conversation for more than 5 minutes. I had to force myself to go out and meet people because I didn't want to be alone, and I didn't want to be around other people if I didn't have anything interesting to talk to them about. I had to force myself to go out because I was afraid of getting infected and getting everyone I knew infected. I had to force myself to go out because I was afraid of the unknown, and I didn't want to take any risks. I had to force myself to go out because I was afraid of missing out, and I didn't want to miss out on anything.

I don't know if this is the right time to get vaccinated because there is not enough evidence that it works, but I don't want to take any risks.",8,"I expected the situation to occur at least to some extent.

The narrator is also frustrated that scientists have been testing vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine for treatment, but no one is developing new treatments to avoid lung fibrosis. In both cases, the narrator's desires were partially fulfilled. The virus did evade vaccines, but treatments for COVID-19 do exist.

The UK has been criticized for not doing enough testing, but the number of tests they have done has increased dramatically in recent weeks. The UK is doing more research on treatments and vaccines than any other country in the world, and they have made significant progress. The UK is also leading the world in developing technology to make vaccines that can evade existing vaccines.

This suggests that the pandemic was a significant factor in the narrator's change in mood, but not the only factor. The narrator also describes feeling sad about losing her ""pre-pandemic self"". This suggests that the pre-pandemic self was important to the narrator, and that the pandemic caused her to lose something important.

Cases on the rise indicates that the situation could get worse, as more people could get infected and more resources would be needed to treat them. A tattoo during a pandemic could indicate that the situation would likely get worse, as people may be hesitant to get a tattoo if they think they could get infected by going to the tattoo parlor.",7,"The situation was considered to be somewhat consistent with social norms. The narrator thought that getting a tattoo during the pandemic was a risky thing to do, because they thought that it might increase their chances of getting Covid-19. However, they also thought that they would probably be fine because they would probably not show any symptoms and would therefore not be infectious.",7,The narrator thought that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation where they went through with getting a tattoo despite cases on the rise. The reason for this is because the outcome of getting a tattoo could not be reversed.,7,This answer is not written in the text of the question.,7,"The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to get a tattoo during the pandemic. This is because there was a risk of infection, and the tattoo artist would need to use a needle, which would transmit the infection from one person to another. The narrator was aware of this risk, but decided that the benefits of the tattoo outweighed this risk.",7,"This situation was challenging because I had to go through with a tattoo that I had been thinking about for a long time. I was worried that the tattoo artist would not be able to do a good job because of all the COVID-19 related restrictions. I also was worried that I would somehow get COVID-19 through this tattoo and that this would ruin my life. However, I knew that if I didn't go through with the tattoo, then I would regret it for the rest of my life. As a result, I was really struggling with whether or not to go through with the tattoo. I also was worried that the tattoo would not heal properly because of the COVID-19 related restrictions. In the end, I decided to go through with the tattoo because I felt like I would regret not trying new things and developing myself as a person if I didn't go through with the tattoo.",7,"The situation was somewhat consistent and somewhat inconsistent with the narrator's personal values. The situation was somewhat consistent, because the tattoo artist was a professional, and thus likely knew the health and safety standards that they were following. On the other hand, the tattooing process could be considered inhumane, as the animals are often held in cramped conditions and killed by being injected with high doses of anesthetic before the tattooing process. The narrator is a vegan, so this was somewhat inconsistent with their personal values. The situation was somewhat inconsistent, because the tattooing process could be considered inhumane.",0,"This is a difficult question to answer as I was hoping I wouldn't get this question because I really like how my tattoo turned out. I really don't think I expected this to happen, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. I guess I'm neutral on this."

The symptoms described (sore arm, headache, feeling of brain fog) are not common side effects of the MMR vaccine, and the narrator's parents thought that it was still the side effects from the MMR vaccine. The brain fog and nausea can be symptoms of more serious issues, such as a low-grade fever or a serious infection. The narrator's parents decided to take them to the doctor, which was the right move. MMR vaccines can cause serious side effects, and it's always good to get a checkup just to be safe.",0,"NA, because the narrator didn't mention anything related to emotional coping",0,"I'm not sure how I would rate myself in this situation.

The brain fog and nausea only lasted for a few hours.",7,"The narrator is clearly not certain about what is happening in the situation. The brain fog and feeling of being in a daze are not symptoms that are typically associated with the common cold or flu. The symptoms seem to be related to the narrator's vaccination two days ago, but it is not clear if the vaccination was the cause or a symptom of this situation. The symptoms seem to be getting worse instead of better, which could be a sign of something more serious. We rate the narrator as being 7, which means the narrator is neutral about what is happening in the situation.",7,"I think the situation was somewhat consistent with what the narrator wanted. The symptoms felt like a ""normal"" side effect profile of the vaccination, and the narrator's parents seemed to think it was consistent with the profile as well. However, the narrator did experience some additional symptoms that they did not expect, such as the headache and feeling dazed at night. The narrator's parents seemed to think that these additional symptoms were ""excessive"" and not consistent with the profile, though they did not elaborate on why they thought this.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation was FAIR because her symptoms came at night, which is unusual for the common flu. She also feels that the situation was FAIR because her parents think that the symptoms were from the flu, when she thinks that they were caused by the vaccination. However, she does think that the situation was not completely unfair because her parents were vaccinated too.",4,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator described feeling dazed at night, which is a more severe symptom than the headache and feeling tired the previous day.",7,The narrator thought the situation was consistent with their internal norms because they said they didn't experience fever or any other symptoms typically associated with a bad reaction to a vaccination.,7,The narrator thinks that something has been lost in the situation because the outcome is irretrievable. The death of a loved one is a clear example of something that is irretrievable. The loss of a child is another example of something irretrievable. The narrator thinks that something has been lost in both of these examples.,0,"I didn't find the situation familiar at all.

It was challenging for me to rate because I'm not sure how I feel about it. On one hand, I feel like I should be more grateful for being healthy, but on the other hand, I also feel like I should be more concerned about the potential long-term effects of the MMR vaccine. I'm not sure how long I've been feeling this way for, but it's been enough time for me to want to talk to a doctor about it.",7,"This situation is completely inconsistent with the narrator's personal values because the narrator is a vegan, and their diet is composed of plants, so they wouldn't eat meat. The meat they would eat has to be killed before being eaten, which is against the vegan philosophy. Therefore, this situation is marked as completely inconsistent on the selected scale.",8,"I expected the situation to occur to some extent. I am a high school student, and I am aware of the prevalence of COVID-19 and the measures that have been taken around the world. I also took the COVID-19 vaccine, so I was expecting some side effects. However, I did not expect to experience brain fog and nausea for over a day. These symptoms seemed more severe than the usual side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, I am concerned that my symptoms may be related to the vaccine."

The narrator wanted to do normal things again so they rated this situation as relevant.,7,"I think the narrator needed to attend to the situation further, because the anxiety their father was experiencing was very serious. The narrator knew that their father was experiencing anxiety because their father was fully vaccinated with Pfizer, and anxiety from a similar vaccine is very serious and requires immediate medical attention. The narrator needed to attend to their father's situation further because they didn't know how to cope with their father's anxiety, and they needed to understand what was causing their father to experience anxiety in the first place in order to find a solution.",0,"The narrator thinks that they are able to emotionally cope with the situation.

The reason for this is not explained in the text. However, it can be assumed that the narrator is able to distract themselves from the problem by being busy, eating comfort food or drinking alcohol.",0,"Narrator thought they were:

But I can tell you that this behavior is not at all controlled by the circumstances. The person who is affected by this behavior should seek professional help.,7,The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation.

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god).

The narrator believes that they were exposed to COVID-19, but it's not clear how exposed the narrator was, since the narrator spent 2 days in close contact with the infected person. The narrator believes that the situation was inconsistent with the narrator's goals because the narrator spent most of the time thinking about COVID-19, which caused the narrator to feel anxious.",7,"I think the situation was FAIR because the narrator was not vaccinated and got infected with COVID-19.

I think it's neutral because I don't know enough about the virus to say whether it would get worse or better. I do know that the narrator was exposed to the virus and was vaccinated, so the CDC doesn't require the narrator to self-isolate. However, the narrator is worried that the situation could get worse because the sick narrator's roommate also got sick, and the narrator's roommate has an autoimmune disorder.",7,"The situation was inconsistent with the external and social norms. The norms in this case are defined by the larger community the narrator is a part of. For example, cheating during an exam is considered wrong, and cutting a queue is considered frowned upon by others.

Therefore, the narrator's perception that the situation was inconsistent with the norms is accurate.",0,NA,7,"I rate this situation as 7 because I believe that I have experienced a similar situation before. However, I cannot specifically recall this situation.

The situation involved a potential exposure to COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially lethal disease. The narrator was exposed to COVID-19, but the narrator was vaccinated, so the narrator didn't feel sick. However, the narrator thought that the situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with the potential exposure, the risk of the disease, and the uncertainty of whether the narrator was immune to the disease.",7,"This situation was challenging, because I was worried about the narrator and their safety. I was also worried about my own safety, because I was still wearing a mask and hadn't yet received a COVID-19 diagnosis. I was also struggling with the uncertainty of the situation, because I didn't know how effective the narrator's vaccination was against COVID-19, and whether or not I was at risk of infection.",0,NA,8,"I expected the situation to occur to some extent, as I had been talking to my friend for a year and a half about getting vaccinated and the risks of not getting vaccinated. I also knew that she had recently gotten vaccinated, and that she had a lot of work to do to get her vaccine schedule up to speed. I didn't expect the situation to occur to the extent that it did, as I had not been in close contact with someone who had COVID-19 for at least 14 days prior to the exposure, as advised by the CDC. However, I did expect that she would get sick, as even though I had been vaccinated, I am a carrier of the virus, and my immune system is not fully capable of fighting off the virus."
ojn25q,0,NA,0,"I'm not sure how I feel about this question, so I'll try to be as honest as possible. I don't think other people were at all responsible for causing the situation we are in right now. I think the situation was completely caused by the Covid-19 virus, and I think that the people who have been irresponsible are the ones who refused to take the virus seriously and not wear a mask, leading to widespread infection. However, I do think that other people could have taken more responsibility by being more careful with whom they share their things and by being more hygienic, and I'll mark this answer as a 7 because I can't give it a higher rating.",7,"I selected a score of 7 because I believe that circumstances beyond anyone's control were partially responsible for causing the situation. The spread of COVID-19 is a complex issue that is affected by many factors outside of anyone's control.

The situation with the low number of COVID-19 cases in New Jersey and New York was possibly relevant to the narrator's concerns and goals because the narrator may have felt that the low number of cases could reduce the chance that the narrator or others would get COVID-19 or that the low number of cases could lead to under-vaccination in those states.,7,"The narrator thought that they needed to attend to the situation further because the situation was both complicated and interesting. The situation was complicated because the number of cases in both states were still low compared to winter levels, but both states had already recorded more cases than any other states. The situation was interesting because the number of cases were still low, but the number of new cases were increasing.

The narrator seems to think that the number of cases being reported were being artificially lowered. However, the number of cases reported were being reported by the New York Times, a reputable source. Furthermore, the number of cases reported in both states were still relatively low compared to the number of people in those states. Therefore, I do not believe that other people were controlling the situation.",0,I don't know why the scale is NA. I can tell you that the circumstances were not at all controlling.

It is possible that neither state will experience the same surge that the unvaccinated regions are.",7,"The narrator is clearly uncertain about what was happening in the situation. The rates of the two states, New Jersey and New York, are close to each other but not at the levels seen during winter. The narrator describes it as ""creeked over 1"" which implies that the rate is going down, not up. The case numbers in both states are nowhere near the levels seen during winter. The narrator describes it as ""not even close"" which implies that the states are not on track to reach the levels seen during winter.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with what I wanted, but not completely. I wanted both states to have high numbers of COVID-19 cases, because that would show that the pandemic was effectively under control. However, I think that the numbers that both states have are too low, because that would mean that the pandemic was not under control. I wanted both states to have high numbers of cases so that the federal government would continue to provide financial aid to the states, because I think that the money that the federal government provides to states that do not vaccinate their children is not enough to make up for the economic damage that not vaccinating causes. However, I think that the numbers that both states have are too low, because the money that the federal government provides is not enough to make up for the economic damage that not vaccinating causes.",7,"I don't know that I would give the current situation a 7. I would maybe give it a 5. The current situation is not completely fair, because the unvaccinated regions are not experiencing the same surge that the vaccinated regions are. However, the situation could be a 7 if the number of cases in the unvaccinated regions were closer to the number of cases that the vaccinated regions were at the start of the pandemic.",1,"I rated the situation as a 7 because the number of confirmed cases in both New Jersey and New York are still very low in comparison to other states, and the number of deaths are also very low. However, the number of states that have been impacted by COVID-19 is still very high, and the number of deaths is also rising. I believe that the situation will eventually get better, but it will take time for the number of confirmed cases and deaths to rise to a level that is more comparable to other countries and regions around the world.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with what my larger community defines as right or wrong. Cheating during an exam is wrong, and so is cutting a queue. Both New Jersey and New York recorded less than 1,000 cases, which is far less than the number that would normally be seen during a typical winter.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the number of COVID-19 cases in both New Jersey and New York have not reached the levels seen during the winter months. Winter surges are a phenomenon that occurs in many regions of the world when the weather patterns cause a spike in the number of cases of a particular disease. During a winter surge, the number of cases seen during a given period of time is much higher than the number of cases one would normally expect to see during that timeframe in a given location. The increase in cases is often caused by people traveling to regions where winter surges have occurred in the past, catching the disease, and then spreading it to regions where the disease is not as prevalent. The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the number of COVID-19 cases in both New Jersey and New York have not reached the levels seen during the winter months.",7,I think the situation was familiar because I experienced a very similar situation in the past.,7,"7 - The narrator thought that a large amount of effort was needed to deal with the situation

The situation was that both New Jersey and New York's rate of transmissions both creeked over 1, but the case numbers in both cases are nowhere near winter surge levels. Not even close. Jersey today recorded only 333 cases, while New York recorded sub 800, according to the NY Times.

So MAYBE there's a chance that neither state will experience the same surge that the unvaccinated regions are.",7,"The situation is challenging because it requires me to acknowledge that I may be wrong about something I've been thinking about for a long time, and that I may need to change my beliefs or at least be open to new beliefs. I'm also challenged by the idea that I may need to compromise on some of my values in order to do what I think is right. I'm not sure how much of this is actually challenging because I'm a person who likes to be right about things, and I like to feel like I'm in control, but I'll mark this as a 7 because I think that's an accurate assessment.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with my personal values, as I am a vegan and I don't kill animals for food. However, I think it is important to note that I live in New York City, which has a higher population density than many other areas in the United States. As such, I think it is more likely that I will come into contact with animals that are killed for food, even though I try to be as careful as possible.",8,"I expected this to occur, because I've been reading and watching a lot of ""anti-vaxxer"" content on the internet. It's very common for people to claim that vaccines are completely unnecessary because ""they don't work"", or that they're only needed for ""emergencies"", or that they cause autism. So when I saw that New York and New Jersey had both recorded over 1000 cases each, I was unsurprised."

It is possible that the narrator thought they were able to control what was happening in the situation because they were the Ohio department of health, which is a government agency in Ohio. Government agencies are often given authority by governments to act on their behalf.

However, it could also be that the narrator thought they were able to control what was happening in the situation because they were getting information from two different sources, and the sources had different opinions on the subject of vaccination.

It is also possible that the narrator was exposed to someone who was tested positive for COVID-19 and was not showing any symptoms, which would put the narrator at risk of being infected with COVID-19.

The risk of getting infected is low, but I can't kiss my girlfriend without risking it. On the other hand, my girlfriend can't kiss me without risking it either.

They also thought that they might not be able to return home to figure out precautions that they need to take for cystic fibrosis (CF).

However, I assume that the narrator is a reasonable person, and so I assume that they thought this situation was fair because they believed that they had all the information necessary to make an informed decision. The information that they had access to was:

The narrator assumed that their friend would be vaccinated before planning the trip, and that she would confirm this with them before coming up with the plans. However, the narrator later found out that their friend was unvaccinated, and so they were concerned that they might be exposed to a potentially dangerous disease. This is a situation where the social norms were consistent with the narrator's EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS, because the community that the narrator is a part of defines unvaccinated individuals as being at risk of exposure to dangerous diseases.",7,The narrator thought that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because they were unable to reverse the outcome of the situation to get back what was originally present (e.g. the death of a loved one).,7,"I'm not entirely sure how familiar this situation is to you, but I assumed that this situation was familiar to me because I have been beaten up by mods for posting in the wrong subs before.

The friend's prediction frightened the narrator, which the narrator believes indicates that the friend has a deeper understanding of the subject of vaccinations than the narrator does. The narrator believes that if the friend's prediction comes true, then the friend will be able to suppress the rise in vaccinations, which the narrator believes will be bad for the narrator because the friend is the narrator's only source of information about the subject of vaccinations, and if the friend is unable to suppress the rise in vaccinations then the narrator will have no way of learning more about the subject of vaccinations.

The mandates have gotten more and more strict over time, with the most recent mandate stating that all residents must wear a face mask in public if they cannot maintain 6-foot social distancing, which includes when in a vehicle or outside.

The narrator was also happy with the progress they were making, so that was also consistent.",7,"I think the situation was completely unfair. The therapist was treating the patient in question, but not requiring the patient to wear a mask. The mask policy was completely unfair to people who were vaccinated but had at-risk children. The narrator likes the therapist and thinks they are seeing good progress, but is worried about getting the rest of their appointments cancelled. The situation is complicated by the fact that the patient in question is making the narrator feel uncomfortable due to their mask-under-the-nose behavior.",7,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator is frustrated that he is unable to fully complete his physical therapy treatment due to the patient's mask policy, even though he is making good progress and has a positive attitude towards the therapist. The patient's mask policy is not necessary safe, and the narrator is justified in being frustrated by his inability to complete his treatment.",7,"The situation was inconsistent with the external and social norms. People wearing masks in public is considered normal. Wiping down therapy gear after using it on one patient and not cleaning it after is considered poor hygiene. The therapist is otherwise a good person, but the situation with the patient not wearing a mask under his nose made me feel uncomfortable and judged.",7,"The narrator thought that something has been lost in the situation because the therapist was treating the patient in the manner in which they were behaving, even though the therapist was aware of the risk of infection due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The narrator thought that something has been totally lost because the patient's personal hygiene could facilitate the spread of the infection.",7,"I think the situation was familiar because I have experienced a similar situation in the past. I have gone to physical therapy before, and while the staff was doing their hygiene theatre, other patients were not wearing their masks under their noses. I felt like my usual eye roll and judgements about people's behavior were appropriate in this situation. However, I do feel that the situation with the patient not wearing a mask under their nose was more egregious, and I was torn between cancelling my remaining appointments with my therapist or not cancelling and potentially infecting others.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation.,7,"I am torn between just cancelling the rest of my appointments or how I might confront them about the issue?

I think the situation was challenging because I had to make a decision that was difficult for me. I am a person who likes to be open to new experiences and willing to put in the work to try new things. On the one hand, I am very concerned about the spread of COVID-19 and the safety of my expected treatment. On the other hand, I really like my therapist and feel like I am making progress. So, I am struggling with how to balance my concerns and desires.",7,"The situation was somewhat consistent with my personal values as a vegan, as I don't believe in killing animals for food. However, I do think that wearing a face mask during a pandemic is a good practice, and I don't think it should be taken lightly. I personally feel that the therapist in this situation did not take the pandemic seriously, as she was allowing a patient to not wear a mask under his nose, which could potentially spread the virus.",7,"I was expecting this situation to occur about half the time. The physical therapist I've been seeing has a very good reputation, and I've been going to her for about 6 months. However, I've recently read a lot about the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk of infection from asymptomatic carriers. I've also read that some people's immune systems cannot handle the stress of a new infection, and they become very ill. I've got a young kid who is too young to get vaccinated, but who is medically at-risk. He is currently staying with my parents, who live close to my therapist's office. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated. I'm halfway through my expected treatment, and I'm feeling good about my progress. However, I'm also feeling torn between cancelling my remaining appointments with my therapist, or confronting her about this issue."

The reason is because the kid's vaccine is being held up for 4 months after the results come out, which means that kids will have to go an additional 4 months without a vaccine, which is far longer than necessary. The author feels that something irretrievable has been lost because kids will lose out on the opportunity to have the vaccine before the school year starts, which could lead to more children missing school and spreading the virus further.",7,"The situation was familiar to me, as I have experienced similar situations in the past. The most recent example of this was when I was in college, and the university decided to move up the start date of the semester by four weeks. I was not happy about this, as I was not ready for a summer semester, and the change resulted in me having to take two more classes than I would have otherwise had to. I also was concerned that the change would cause problems for me financially, as I was not able to find a new job, and had to rely on financial aid to pay for my tuition. Both of these concerns were realized when I had to take an extra two classes, and my financial aid was not sufficient to pay for all of my tuition and fees. I was also not able to find a new job, as I was forced to put my job search on hold until after the semester started.

In this case, I am concerned that waiting four months after the vaccine is developed before giving it to children will have similar consequences to the ones I experienced in college.

The FDA requiring everyone to get a vaccine is similar to previous situations where the FDA had to force the general public to get vaccinated to prevent an epidemic. However, the general public usually complies with the FDA's request because vaccines are very safe and have a very low risk of side effects. Therefore, the general public usually rates the situation as being familiar.

Therefore, the unvaccinated individuals usually rate the situation as being unfamiliar.",7,The narrator thinks it requires a lot of effort to deal with the situation because the FDA hasn't just come forward and required everyone to get vaccinated. The FDA has instead chosen to work with the private companies that make the vaccines to come up with a solution that would make it voluntary for the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. The FDA thinks it has to work with the companies because it doesn't have the legal authority to force people to get vaccinated. The FDA thinks it requires a lot of effort to deal with the situation because it has to find a solution that works for both the companies and the people who don't want to vaccinate their children.,0,"I don't know how the narrator felt about the challenge they faced, but I think it's safe to say that they perceived the situation as challenging. The FDA had just approved a new vaccine, and many people were still skeptical of it. The public's trust in vaccines was already low, and the FDA needed to do something to regain people's confidence. Furthermore, anti-vaccination groups were using the opportunity to spread misinformation and doubt. The FDA could have mandated that everyone get vaccinated, but that would have made the situation easier to manage. Instead, they chose to take a more nuanced approach, which required them to educate the public and combat misinformation on both sides. This approach was more challenging, but it also had the potential to yield better results in the long run.",7,"I personally think that the situation is completely consistent with my personal values, as I am vegan and I don't kill animals for food.",8,"I expected the situation to occur to some extent.

At the same time, I'm excited to learn more about this field and how I can contribute in a meaningful way. I'm also struggling with how to communicate effectively with my friends, because I don't want to upset them or make them feel worse than they already do. I'm worried that my friends might be feeling even more isolated than they already are, and I don't want to add to their stress. I'm excited to see how I can help my friends get tested for the virus, and I'm hopeful that they will both get tested negative, so that we can all be close again. I'm also nervous about getting the virus myself, because I'm in a high-risk group and I don't have any underlying health conditions.

Other people were not taking the pandemic seriously enough, and therefore did not take the necessary precautions. This led to the pandemic spreading more quickly and more widely, which caused a lot of economic damage and caused a lot of people to lose their jobs. As a result, other people are now feeling the effects of the pandemic themselves, and are therefore likely to be more understanding of the difficulties that the narrator is facing.

The selected scale is Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha.

In my opinion, the situation would get worse because the number of cases is still increasing and the peak of the hospitalization rate was 1/4 of Alpha, which was much higher than the normal rate.

The peak of Scotland's cases indicates the highest number of cases in a specific area during a certain period of time. The spike in cases indicates that the number of cases increased rapidly during a certain period of time. The hospitalization rate is the number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people. The Alpha variant was much more damaging than the Delta variant because the Alpha variant caused more deaths and hospitalizations. The Delta variant caused less deaths and hospitalizations than the Alpha variant because people were vaccinated against Alpha.

The spike in cases of the virus can be attributed to multiple factors, including the variants, which are different types of influenza. The text describes the Alpha and Delta variants, with the Alpha variant being more damaging due to its length and the Delta variant being less damaging due to its shorter length. The vaccination rate in Scotland likely played a large role in determining the speed of recovery, as the narrator believes that the more people who are vaccinated, the faster the recovery.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation.

In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was.

Scotland's cases also peaked much later for the delta variant than for the alpha variant, and had crashed by the end of July. The hospitalization's peak for the delta variant also topped out at 1/4 that of the alpha variant.

The patient has been sick for one week and the latest oxygen saturation were quite high (around 80-90% with and without support). So the narrator asked if the patient has 60-70% lung saturation.

The answer to this question depends on the patient's current condition. If the patient is experiencing respiratory distress, or has a fever or other symptoms of COVID-19, then it is likely that the patient's saturation is lower. However, if the patient is asymptomatic or has only mild symptoms, then the saturation may be normal.

In short, the answer to the narrator's question depends on the patient's current condition, and the narrator is clearly uncertain about the patient's condition.",7,"This situation is completely consistent with what I want, because I want this pandemic to be over with as soon as possible.

Cutting a queue during a pandemic is also wrong, since it could lead to the spread of the virus. The larger community's disapproval of these behaviors implies that the situation is highly inconsistent with what the larger community defines as right or wrong.",0,The narrator thought that something has been totally lost.

The narrator is concerned that the patient's oxygen saturation is around 70%.,7,"This is a familiar situation for me, as I have experienced similar situations in the past.",7,The narrator thought that they needed to exert a lot of effort to deal with the situation because the patient was sick for almost one week and their latest oxygen levels were high (around 80-90% with and without support). The narrator thought that 60-70% lung saturation was something to worry about.,7,"This situation was challenging because my partner and I are new parents and this is the first time we've had to take on the role of primary caregiver for both of our children. While we both work full-time, our roles as parents often require us to be on-call 24/7, which leaves us with very little time to ourselves. This time, however, our son was sick and needed our full attention. We were worried that he wouldn't sleep, so we took him to the doctor, who said he was fine. The next day, our son's oxygen levels were still very high, and we were starting to get worried. The doctor reassured us that this was completely normal for a baby his age, but we still weren't comfortable with the situation. We decided to take him to the emergency room, where a chest X-ray revealed that he had a serious lung infection. We immediately drove him to the hospital, where he was admitted into the pediatric intensive care unit and placed on a breathing machine. We were shocked by this turn of events, but the doctors said that babies with his condition often experience rapid lung development, which can lead to high oxygen levels. Fortunately, our son's condition improved quickly, and he was released from the hospital a week later",7,My personal values are that I don't kill animals for food. The situation was completely consistent with my personal values because the patient has high oxygen levels without any support and is almost one week sick. This means the patient was unable to clear out the viruses fast enough and was getting sicker and sicker.,7,"This is a very common question, and I am not sure how I would rate this situation. I expect that a patient with high oxygen saturation would be a patient with high oxygen support. However, I was surprised to see the saturation was consistently at 80-90% with and without support. I would not rate this situation as completely unexpected."

I expected the COVID situation to improve in the US, with the number of cases and deaths decreasing. However, the numbers continued to increase in some states, even though many states had begun to take action to slow the spread of the virus. As a result, many people started to lose confidence in the government's ability to manage the situation, and they started to doubt the validity of the data and the reliability of the statistics.

The narrator has told his brother and sister-in-law that he will go to the gender reveal party, but now the narrator is uncertain about whether or not he should go.

The party is 200 miles from where the narrator lives, and the narrator lives in one of the worst Delta hotspots in the US. Given this information, the narrator is very hesitant about going to the gender reveal party.",7,"I'm not sure if this is the right advice for everyone, but I think I would have gone regardless. I'm not sure if my brother and sister-in-law would have appreciated me going to their gender reveal party even if I wasn't an uncle, and I didn't want to miss out on this opportunity to be an uncle. I'm also not sure if I would have been comfortable leaving her with my parents, who I don't live with, while I was in the area. I'm not sure if I would have been comfortable with the risk of her getting the virus, either. But I'm glad I went. She had a great time, and I got to spend time with her and my parents. And my brother and sister-in-law surprised me with a trip to Disneyland for my birthday a couple weeks later!",7,"The situation is 7.5 because the distance between the narrator's location and the party location is 200 miles. This is a very large distance to travel in the current pandemic, and the party could be considered a large gathering. The party could also be considered a gender reveal party, which is problematic but not a reason to refuse a travel request. The risk of contracting COVID-19 at the party is relatively high, and the risk of dying from COVID-19 is very high. The risk of the baby being vaccinated is low, but the baby could still receive the vaccination later. The risk of the baby being injured during the vaccination is very low, but the baby could still be injured in any case. The risk of the baby being born with disabilities is very low, but the baby could still be born with disabilities. The risk of the baby being born dead is very high, and the baby could be born dead regardless of the risk factors.",0,"Given the current situation in Delta, it is very difficult to tell how this situation will unfold. The narrator is very concerned that he will get infected with COVID-19 and that this will negatively impact his brother and sister-in-law. However, it is also likely that the situation in Delta will get worse before it gets better, because COVID-19 is likely to spread more quickly in a community with limited access to medical care. In this case, the narrator’s concern that he could get COVID-19 and pass it on to his brother and sister-in-law would likely be justified. However, the same cannot be said of the opposite situation, in which the situation in Delta gets better and the narrator no longer needs to worry about getting COVID-19. In this case, the narrator would likely be relieved that he does not need to travel to his brother and sister-in-law’s location, but he would need to weigh the potential benefits of this situation (e.g., spending more time with his brother and sister-in-law) against the potential costs (e.g., losing time from work to travel to Delta), which might not be worth it if the situation in Delta improves significantly.",7,"I rate the consistency of the situation with my external and social norms as 7.

I've been in a situation where I was going to be an uncle for the first time, and my brother and sister-in-law were doing a gender reveal party. The party was problematic to me because I believe that gender reveal parties are inherently sexist, but that's a separate issue. The more important thing is that they were living in one of the worst Delta hotspots in the US, and I was concerned that the virus could spread to them through casual contact. I told them that I was going to support them, but I was very hesitant about it because I hadn't experienced this situation before and I didn't know how to navigate it.

The narrator is a vegan, and their brother-in-law is planning on having a party where animal products will be served. The party will take place in a area with a high number of COVID cases, and the animal products are likely to be COVID carriers (e.g. pigs and chickens). The party will also involve travel, which is a high risk factor for the COVID spread. The party is also inconsistent with the narrator being a respectful person, as they will be attending while wearing a mask, but the mask is likely to be dirty, as the party will be in a house, and the party will involve food (eating and touching).",7,This is a 7 because the situation was completely expected. This is because the gender reveal party is problematic and the narrator is a first-time uncle.

The narrator is afraid that as a society, we will regress into our pre-vaccinated behavior. They fear that two months of normalcy will lead to feelings of betrayal by the vaccine, and that as a society we will regress into our pre-vaccinated behavior.",7,I am worried about our collective societys mental health. My friends that I have spoken to that recently tested positive and have mild symptoms despite being vaccinated are feeling betrayed by the vaccine. I dont think we should be feeling this way. I also understand a big source of anger is that so many unvaccinated people caused this spike. I feel like this argument is so futile because shouldnt have this been part of the equation or formula making?

At the same time, the narrator is also conflicted about the potential harms of vaccinations, and expresses concern that the COVID-19 pandemic could be man-made and that the spread of COVID-19 among the unvaccinated could lead to the emergence of a more dangerous strain. The narrator's ambivalence about the necessity and dangers of vaccinations makes it difficult for me to determine how much the narrator is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic.",0,I don't think the narrator thinks other people are responsible for causing the situation. The argument is presented that natural immunity could actually be of no help at all because of variants.

I believe that the narrator is confusing control with influence. The unvaccinated people may be a large enough pool that each new variant will be able to spread to everyone, but this does not mean that the variants will be progressively worse. In fact, I believe that the variants will remain relatively stable, and that it is the unvaccinated people who will be able to spread them to everyone else.

Herd immunity is when a large %age of a population has been infected with a disease, such that the disease cannot easily spread through the population. This is because if a person is immune to a disease, they can ""protect"" others from getting infected. This is in contrast to ""natural immunity"", where only a person's own immunity protects them from getting infected. The narrator believes that they are not close to achieving herd immunity, because even with the current COVID-19 pandemic, there are still large numbers of people who have not been vaccinated, and so the disease is still able to spread through the population. The narrator believes that if they do not achieve herd immunity, then the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to spread like ""wildfire"", and the disease will not be able to ""peak fitness"" (achieve its optimal survival conditions) because new variants will continue to emerge, and these will be worse than the previous ones. The narrator believes that eventually, the COVID-19 pandemic will reach ""peak fitness"", but this will only be after many years, because the pandemic will be able to spread to almost everyone, and so the variants that emerge will have time to spread to everyone.",0,"I don't know the author's intent, but I think the situation is neutral, maybe slightly pleasant. The argument is based on the idea that Covid would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, the narrator seems to doubt this, because even if natural immunity doesn't protect against all variants, some variants, such as Delta, could still be reinfected with natural immunity.

I think the author may be trying to convey that the situation is neutral, because the argument against herd immunity through natural infections is based on the idea that natural immunity wouldn't protect against all variants, but the argument against is still valid because even if that were the case, the natural immunity would protect against all variants except for those that emerge after the natural immunity was developed.

The thought that a worse variant could emerge and reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them, is a very plausible scenario. And it is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.",7,"I am not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, I agree with the narrator that herd immunity is a bad idea because it would leave the unvaccinated open to potentially dangerous infections. On the other hand, I don't want to get vaccinated because I don't want to contribute to the herd immunity that would leave the unvaccinated open to dangerous infections. So, I am conflicted.",8,"I think the situation is fair. The argument that the narrator presents to doubt if natural immunity could actually help has not been clearly presented to me, and I think it is a valid concern. I don't think that the argument that ""variants emerge"" is a valid concern, because I don't think that this is a random process. I think that the process is driven by the fact that the human race is continuously expanding its geographical range, and as a result, is continuously bringing new variants into contact with previously isolated variants. I think that this is a positive-sum game, and that the emergence of new variants is a sign of progress.",7,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator is worried that the new variant, if it emerges, would be even worse than the last and could reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them.",7,"I rate this situation as highly inconsistent with my expectations because I would not expect a situation involving herd immunity to be consistent with what I would expect from an EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS-consistent situation. Herd immunity is a concept that implies a certain level of ""normalcy"" in the sense that most people in a population are immune to a disease, such that the disease can spread unhindered among the population. In an EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS-consistent situation, people would conform to the EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS, and therefore would not be immune to the disease. However, in a herd immunity situation, the EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS imply that most people in the population should not be immune to the disease. Therefore, this situation seems highly inconsistent with what I would expect from an EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS-consistent situation.",0,"I don't think the narrator thought that something irretrievable has been LOST in the situation. The narrator was worried that if we went the natural immunity route, we would just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. However, the narrator does think that something irretrievable has been LOST in the situation if they thought that the unvaccinated people would get COVID and then not get vaccinated, leading to the COVID virus spreading unchecked and eventually leading to a worse pandemic than we have now.",7,"I think the narrator is worried that the situation they described is similar to previous experiences the narrator had encountered in the past. The narrator describes several aspects of the situation that they believe are similar to previous experiences, such as the possibility of a new, progressively worse variant emerging, and this being difficult to see through because of the ""perpetual cycle"" of each new variant reinfecting those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreading like wildfire among them.",7,"The narrator thinks that effort is needed to deal with the situation because the situation involves a virus that is progressively worse and could produce new variants that are even worse than the previous ones. The narrator thinks that if the situation were not dealt with, it would lead to a perpetual cycle of progressively worse variants, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.",7,"The scenario described is very challenging, but I think the narrator sees an opportunity to develop themselves and grow. The scenario describes a thought experiment about a virus that evolves to become progressively worse, which the narrator believes would lead to extinction of the virus due to lack of infectivity on the unvaccinated. The thought experiment is interesting, but I think the narrator could also see the scenario as an opportunity to learn more about how to respond to a pandemic, and how to be more self-sufficient.",7,"I think that the argument that ""bad"" variants could emerge and lead to a new pandemic with each subsequent year is completely consistent with my personal values. I believe in being a vegan, and I don't want to harm or kill any living beings for food. I also think it's important to be respectful of other people and other living beings, and I don't think it's okay to harm or kill any living beings. I think it's possible for a new pandemic.",8,"I was surprised by the possibility of a worse variant emerging. I had not considered the possibility of a worse variant emerging, but it makes sense. Even if a variant is not as contagious or deadly as the current pandemic, it can still cause problems if it reinfects someone who has already been infected with the current pandemic. This could cause the pandemic to spread even more rapidly, or cause a new pandemic that is even more contagious or deadly than the current one."

The son also doesn’t want to be vaccinated, and the narrator is debating whether or not to allow the son to get vaccinated.

The narrator also thought that their son and they themselves were very tired, which the text describes as being fatigued, like pass out fatigue. The narrator also lost over 30 pounds, which the text describes as being weak.

The narrator is clearly not in control of their children and is suffering from the consequences of their decisions.,0,"I answered this question with ""NA"" because I do not think the text addressed how I thought other people were controlling the situation.

I think the narrator may be referring to her son when she says ""my son and I"". The son is likely the narrator and the ""I"" in that sentence refers to the narrator. The son is being controlled by the narrator because she is making decisions for him. The son may also be referring to other people when he says ""they want to do more"". I think he may be referring to other people in the family who want him to get better so they can let him make decisions for himself.

I think the other people in the situation who the narrator is referring to when she says ""other people"" are the people who want to go out and socialize. The narrator does not want to go out and socialize because she thinks that will lead to the spread of Covid. She is trying to protect herself and her family by not going out.

I think the people in the situation who are not being controlled by the narrator are the son and the 15 year old.

My son and I still struggle with communication, but I now know that this is a skill I need to work on too.

The situation was complicated by the fact that the husband was concerned that the children might have COVID-19, but also interested because there had been recent news of people who had been vaccinated for COVID-19 who still tested positive for the virus, so the narrator thought the husband would need to attend to this situation to be able to make an informed decision about whether to travel or not.",0,The narrator thinks that they were not able to emotionally cope with the event,7,"I don't understand what the narrator is asking me to rate.

He would not be able to quarantine from the rest of the family after such a long trip, given that our home is small.

The narrator may also think that the mom is morally reprehensible for planning on lying to get additional shots, but again, isn't it the Moderna vaccine that is falsely advertising the immunity period?",7,I think other people were somewhat responsible for the situation because my mom only believes vaccines cause immunity to last for 6 months. She has access to the internet and could have found evidence to the contrary.,0,NA,0,"The narrator thought they were unable to cope, as the event was morally reprehensible and could negatively impact their relationship. The text does not address why the narrator thought they were unable to cope.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation is relevant, as they want to help their mom understand the Israeli studies. The narrator believes that the Israeli studies are credible, and think they should be taken into consideration. However, they also think that their mom should focus on studies showing that Moderna shots provide immunity for at least a year. They think that their mom is being irrational in fearing that the Moderna shot will not provide immunity for more than 6 months.",7,"The narrator thought that their mom needed to attend to the situation because she was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months and was morally reprehensible for lying to get a third shot. The situation was complicated because the narrator didn't know where their mom got the information about the duration of vaccine immunity from, and didn't know if it was true. It was dangerous because their mom had a history of panic attacks, and the situation was interesting because the narrator thought it was morally reprehensible to lie to get a third shot and that it was interesting to hear about a situation where someone had to lie to get a third shot.",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,"The narrator thinks that circumstances beyond anyone's control were controlling what was happening in the situation. The text does not mention any specific circumstances beyond anyone's control, so the narrator thinks that circumstances were controlling.",0,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next. The reason for this is that the situation was specifically about a person who is scared of the delta variant of the flu and who is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator cited Israeli studies that show that the immunity from the flu shot lasts longer than 6 months, and the person being scared of the delta variant is wrong about this.",0,NA,7,"I think the situation was neutral, because I don't think the narrator's mom's concerns about the duration of vaccine immunity were justified. The 6 month duration of immunity is based on a model which assumes that people receive all of their vaccines simultaneously, which is not the case for most people. It is also only an estimate, and there is not a lot of data to support it. Furthermore, the Israeli studies she was citing did not show that people who got a vaccine had a lower immunity to it than people who did not get the vaccine, they showed that the duration of immunity was shorter in people who got the vaccine than in people who did not get the vaccine. So it seems that the mom was incorrect in her belief that people who got a vaccine had lower immunity to it than people who did not get the vaccine.

I also think the situation was neutral with respect to the mom lying and going to CVS in September. Whether or not this would be pleasant or unpleasant depends on your opinion on lying.",7,"I am not sure why the narrator is convinced that mom is going to fraudulently get herself a third shot in September. It is possible that the narrator has not thought this through and is not sure how the mom will pay for the shot if she does not claim insurance. However, it is also possible that the mom is convinced of this plan and the narrator should do more research before sharing this with others.",7,"I marked this as 7 because the situation was consistent with what the narrator wanted. The narrator is convinced that their mom is scared from the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator is convinced that their mom is morally reprehensible for trying to get a third shot. The Moderna shot was administered in March, so by September the immunity should be over by the narrator's standards.",7,"I think the situation is completely unfair. My mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity from vaccines is not legitimate, and that the delta virus can survive longer than that. There is no evidence for this, and the Israeli studies she keeps citing are flawed. She is morally reprehensible for lying to get a third shot.",7,"I think the situation would get neutral, because the narrator's mom is convinced that delta variant immunity only lasts 6 months, and so she will claim to get a third shot in September, even though she got her Moderna shot in March. However, the third shot is probably the monovalent vaccine against COVID-19, which is still under development, and so it's not yet known whether immunity from that would last more than 6 months.",7,"The situation was moderately consistent with the external and social norms. The narrator thinks that their mom's behavior is morally reprehensible, so most people would likely agree with this sentiment. However, it is not a consensus opinion, so this response would likely be considered ""Neutral"" by a large portion of the population.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity period of the vaccine has expired, and is trying to get a 3rd shot. The mom is convinced that the Israeli studies showing a 6 month immunity period are proof that moderna shots are not effective. The mom is morally reprehensible for trying to get a 3rd shot when children may need that shot by then.",0,I think the situation was not familiar to the narrator because they did not experience this situation before. The situation is that the narrator's mom is scared of the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator believes that this is not familiar because delta variant is a new variant of the corona virus and that the corona virus immunity lasts for at least 18 months.,7,The narrator thinks their mom needed to exert effort to deal with the situation because she was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasted 6 months. She cited Israeli studies to bolster her claim. The narrator thinks this is morally reprehensible because children may need those shots by then.,0,NA,0,"I think the situation is completely inconsistent with the values of being a vegan and not killing animals for food. The narrator is a vegan, and the text describes their mom as being scared of the delta variant. It is not clear how killing animals for food relates to being scared of the delta variant, but I do not believe that this is a situation in which a vegan would want to participate.",8,"I expected my mom to be scared of the delta variant because of the Israeli studies. However, I wasn't expecting her to be convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. I think it's likely that she got her Moderna shot in March. So, assuming September follows March, she will have gotten two shots by then. She will be able to get a third shot at that point, even though it's likely she will have already developed immunity. I think this is morally reprehensible, but not because she is trying to get a third shot (I don't think that's morally reprehensible at all). I think she is lying about not having health insurance so she can go to CVS and get a third shot."
oq8fz0,7,I don't understand what this question is asking. The narrator is Mexican and is studying in France. They are currently in Mexico for the summer. They will return to France for the winter. The question asks me to assess the narrator on whether or not they think they are responsible for causing the situation. I don't understand what the question is asking and therefore cannot answer it. Please clarify.,0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,7,"The narrator thinks that this situation is relevant to their concerns and goals because they are studying in France and will soon be vaccinating against COVID there. They are concerned about being immunosupressed and thus susceptible to COVID, and think this situation will allow them to assess the risks of taking a ""second dose"" of a COVID vaccine.",7,"I think the narrator in this text needed to attend to the situation further, because it was complicated, dangerous, and interesting. The narrator is studying in France, and is concerned that taking a ""second dose"" of a COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico might put their girlfriend, who is immunosupressed, at risk. The text describes the situation as ""complicated"" because it involves different countries' policies on counting COVID-19 antibodies as equivalent to having been vaccinated, as well as different COVID-19 vaccines available in Mexico, and the risk that taking a ""second dose"" of a COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico might put their girlfriend at risk. The situation is dangerous because the narrator is concerned about being out in public with their girlfriend, who needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. The situation is interesting because the narrator is studying in France, and wants to know more about the situation in Mexico, and what their options are for taking a ""second dose"" of a COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico.",0,NA,7,"I don't understand what this question is asking. Are you asking me to rate how much I thought I was in control of the situation? If so, I don't understand what that has to do with this question. This question seems to be asking me to rate my perceived ability to control the risks associated with being close to my girlfriend, who has an immune deficiency. I don't know enough about that subject to rate my perceived control of it. Please clarify your question.",0,"I don't know why the narrator thought that other people were controlling what was happening, but he mentioned that other people were controlling him because of his girlfriend's care. It could be that he was worried that she would get infected if he decided to take a risk and take a second dose of the mRNA vaccine in Mexico, so he was seeking reassurance from others that he was allowed to take the risk.",0,"The circumstances were not controlling. The narrator is a Mexican citizen studying in France. France has a one-dose policy for COVID-19 vaccinations. The narrator was allowed to get a COVID-19 vaccination in December. Since there was still a risk of COVID-19 at the end of the summer, the narrator decided to get a second COVID-19 vaccination. The decision to get a second COVID-19 vaccination was up to the narrator. The girlfriend of the narrator is immunosupressed and needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. The narrator's parents said that the narrator should not ""risk it"" and should not take a second COVID-19 vaccination.",7,The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation.,0,NA,1,"I rate the situation as pleasant. Although the narrator is concerned about the risk of getting the COVID-19 infection again, he is currently in a safe location and is taking the recommended precautions to prevent infection.",7,"The narrator was completely uncertain about what was happening in the situation. The consequences of the narrator taking a ""second dose"" of mRNA vaccines were not explained.",7,I don't understand what this scale is for.,7,"The situation is completely unfair. The narrator got 1 dose of the mRNA vaccine because of covid exposure in December, even though most countries allow for 2 doses. The decision to only count one dose of the mRNA vaccine is not based on any scientific evidence, and is purely based on France counting the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. The decision to only allow one dose of the mRNA vaccine leaves the narrator concerned about getting a second dose, since mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies.",0,I don't understand what this question is asking. Could you please clarify?,7,"The narrator expressed concern that their actions might be inconsistent with the norms of their community, since they were from Mexico and were studying in France, and France has a policy of only allowing one dose of the mRNA vaccine.",0,NA,7,"The narrator is Mexican and is studying in France. They are concerned about getting COVID-19 and vaccinations at the same time. They are concerned that they have already received a COVID-19 vaccination with Moderna, and that receiving a second COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V, or Sinovac would count as double vaccination, since they produced antibodies in response to the first Moderna vaccination. They think that their situation is familiar because they experienced a similar situation with Moderna vaccinations.",0,NA,7,"This situation was challenging because it required the narrator to assess their risk-assessment for their girlfriend's safety, which is always a little scary because of their work that puts them out in the street often. They also had to balance their parents' advice against what their girlfriend needs in order to stay healthy.",7,"I personally believe that the situation was completely consistent with my personal values. I am a vegan, and do not eat meat or animal products. The vaccination with Moderna, which only allowed me to get one dose, would typically be completely inconsistent with my personal values. However, because of my concern about my girlfriend, who is immunosupressed and who would be at risk of getting infected if she were to get close to me, I decided to register and take the ""second dose"" here in Mexico. Specially if it were Pfizer, since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies.",0,"I expected this situation to occur, as I am a Mexican citizen studying in France and thus subject to the French vaccination policy. I expected to receive only one dose of the mRNA vaccine because I had covid in December, and this is how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated."
