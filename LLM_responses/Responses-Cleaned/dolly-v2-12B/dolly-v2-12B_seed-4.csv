o7lkru,0,NA,0,"I don't believe that other people are responsible for the current situation in Israel. The Israeli government has taken many effective measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and it is unlikely that so many people could be infected unless there were many more cases in Israel than have been publicly reported. The number of infected people in Israel is still relatively low in comparison to other countries, and the number of people who have died is also relatively low. In my opinion, other people are not responsible for the current situation in Israel, and the fear that the situation may deteriorate is irrational.",8,"The circumstances beyond anyone's control were very responsible for causing the situation. The Israeli government's reinstitution of the mask mandate after a few hundred people were diagnosed with COVID-19 was a surprise to the public. The public's fear that COVID-19 will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history was strengthened by the fact that Israel has not achieved herd immunity. Herd immunity is when 70% of a population is immune to a virus, so that the virus cannot easily spread. Even with this in mind, Israel is still susceptible to COVID-19 outbreaks, because they have not achieved herd immunity and because kids are more vulnerable to the virus than adults are.",6,"I thought that I was able to cope with the consequences of the event. I rate this scale a 6 because the Israeli government's re-institution of the mask mandate caused a spike in the price of masks, which in turn caused a spike in the price of other medical supplies, such as hand sanitizer. However, I was able to cope by making sure that I had a stockpile of both masks and hand sanitizer, and by reducing the amount of social activities that I participated in.",7,"The situation was relevant to my concerns and goals because I live in Israel and recently the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",7,"The narrator thought that they needed to attend to the situation, because even though Israel has not achieved herd immunity, the country is still at risk of an outbreak. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",0,"The narrator thought they were unable to cope with the consequences of the event because:
1 - ""Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19."" The 300 Israelis that were diagnosed with COVID-19 was a traumatic experience that caused a lot of fear in the narrator. The fear caused the narrator to think about the problem of the lack of herd immunity and being at risk of another outbreak for the rest of human history.
2 - ""They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone yet."" The narrator thought that Israel was very close to achieving herd immunity, but they were still not at that milestone yet. The reason for this is that the percentage of immunity in Israel is calculated based on the number of fully vaccinated Israelis divided by the total population of Israel. The fully vaccinated Israelis that the narrator is referring to is people that received the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine is not 100% effective, so the percentage of fully vaccinated Israelis that have immunity to COVID-19 is lower than the percentage of herd immunity that the narrator thinks they have achieved.
3 - ""Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small",0,"I am not sure how to rate the narrator's confidence in their ability to control the situation. On one hand, they claim that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, and on the other, they say that it is still possible for an outbreak to take place even with herd immunity still not achieved. I am not sure how to reconcile these two claims. If the narrator is wrong about herd immunity not being achieved, then they were completely unable to control the situation, but if they are correct, then they were completely able to control it. I am marking this as NA because I cannot determine the rating the narrator believes they were able to control the situation.",5,"The narrator thinks that other people are not controlling what is happening in the situation, because Israel has not yet achieved herd immunity.

They believe that the risk of being threatened by an animal is low, and that the risk of failing an exam is low as well.",7,"The situation in Israel right now is neutral, in my opinion. The COVID-19 pandemic is unpleasant, but it is not completely unpleasant. Israel has not achieved herd immunity, so there is a chance that the virus could resurface at some point in the future. However, this likelihood seems very low to me, because Israel has done a very good job of containing the virus so far, and the percentage of immune Israelis is high. In my opinion, the risk of COVID-19 right now is roughly equivalent to the risk of influenza, which is very common and for which there is no effective treatment.",7,"I am very confident about this answer because I have done a lot of research on the topic and I have a strong background in statistics. The number of infections in Israel is minuscule in comparison to the number of infections in other countries around the world. For example, the United States has a population of about 330 million, and as of April 10, it has a total of around 2.3 million confirmed cases and around 200,000 confirmed deaths. By contrast, Israel has a population of about 5.6 million, and as of April 10, it has a total of around 300,000 confirmed cases and around 10,000 confirmed deaths. The number of infections in Israel is growing at a slower rate than in the United States, and the number of deaths is growing at a much slower rate than in the United States. Additionally, the number of infections and deaths in Israel is growing much more slowly than in many other countries around the world. For example, in Europe, the number of infections and deaths is growing much more quickly than in Israel.",7,"The situation in Israel right now is overall consistent with my expectations and desires. Out of all the things I wanted to happen during the pandemic, I thought that Israel would: 1) implement a mask mandate after seeing other countries do so, and 2) ensure that everyone in the country was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. They have done both of these things. However, there are some aspects of the situation that I did not expect or want, such as: 1) the number of cases in Israel is still relatively low compared to other countries, and 2) the number of cases in children is relatively high compared to other countries. These two things are not consistent with what I wanted or expected.

I am happy with the way that things are going in Israel right now, but I also realize that I can't expect the same results that I wanted from the pandemic.

I think the narrator thought a large amount of effort was needed to deal with the situation because they are in the US, they might be worried about the price of healthcare, and they are 19 years old.

The common flu typically causes a fever, fatigue, and a dry cough, while the delta variant can cause a fever and fatigue, but it can also cause severe symptoms like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The delta variant is more likely to spread between people who are close together, and it is more difficult to treat with vaccines or antivirals.

I was hoping that the Delta Variant would lead to the development of a vaccine, but that has not happened.

On one hand, the narrator is frustrated that the WHO had to make the mask recommendation, and it seems like the WHO's decision was very unfair to the narrator. On the other hand, the WHO's recommendation was based on the best available evidence at the time, and the narrator's argument that the mask recommendation was unfair is essentially an argument that the WHO should have known that the mask recommendation would be ineffective and would cause social and economic disruption, but didn't take that into account when making the recommendation. The WHO's recommendation was not completely unfair, but also not completely fair.",0,"The narrator thought that the situation would get worse because the situation was already bad, and the statement that masks would have to be reinstated really annoyed him.

The Delta Variant was a virus that caused major disruptions to everyday life, including social distancing, school closures, and business closures. The Delta Variant was eventually defeated, but only after the narrator's life had been significantly disrupted.",0,The narrator thought that no effort was needed to deal with the situation because they thought the situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with the situation.,7,"The narrator thinks that the situation is challenging because they had to wear a mask, which they hated. They also had to follow all the social distancing and lockdown rules, which made it hard to do the things they wanted to do, such as going out to eat or watching TV.

I was waiting for Covid-19 to spread globally before getting vaccinated, because I was afraid that the vaccine might not be effective anymore. However, the situation is still not fully expected, because the spread of Covid-19 is not fully global yet. I am disappointed, but I understand that it might take some time until a vaccine becomes globally available and effective. I will be able to fully protect myself in about two weeks, and I am glad that I don't have to worry about Covid-19 anymore."

You're not even sure if the Astra Zeneca vaccine is related to the death in your city, you just think it's possible. A 7 rating seems very high for someone who is worried about a vaccine, but not completely convinced of its dangers.",7,"I don't know why the narrator felt this way, but I'll share my experience. I am pro-vaccine and take all of my vaccines. However, I also understand that not everyone feels the same way as I do and that's ok. I think the narrator in this case was concerned that the situation was not consistent with what they wanted, because they were getting anxious about it. They may have felt that the anxiety was justified because they were seeing so many people taking the vaccines and there had been a few deaths in their city related to the vaccines, but I don't think they had enough information to come to that conclusion. I think they needed more information to calm down, or at least have more information to make a more informed decision. I think if they had asked for more information, they would have been able to find more information that would have helped them feel more comfortable with the situation.

I hope this helps!",7,"The situation is completely unfair because the narrator is concerned that the Astra Zeneca vaccines are causing deaths in a small number of people, but there are far more people who would die if the vaccines were not developed.",7,"The narrator is concerned that the situation will get worse because she thinks that there are only approximately 1000 people getting the vaccines in her city, and there are less than 100 deaths in her country.

Do they mean the still mostly unvaxxed world in general, and should we not worry if were in the US or another country with high vaccination rates?

The WHO said this because the Delta variant is a new, emerging virus that is particularly dangerous to people who are not fully vaccinated. The WHO does not trust that people who have been fully vaxxed are protected from this virus, so they recommend that people who are fully vaxxed go back into general lockdown.

However, this is not fair to people who are fully vaxxed. They have already been protected from this virus, and so requiring them to go back into general lockdown is overly burdensome and unfair.

On the other hand, the Delta variant is not particularly dangerous to people who are not fully vaxxed. So, it is fair to not worry if you are not fully vaxxed and are in a country with high vaccination rates.

Do they mean the still mostly unvaxxed world in general, and should we not worry if were in the US or another country with high vaccination rates?

The WHO doesn't recommend routine vaccination, because the vaccine takes several months to produce, and during that time, people would need to continue to rely on other methods to protect themselves from the virus. However, the WHO does recommend that people who can get vaccinated do so. The US and other countries with high vaccination rates should be safe from the Delta variant, but people in countries with lower vaccination rates should take the opportunity to get vaccinated.

Some people are concerned that the",0,NA,7,"This situation is challenging because it is unclear what the WHO means by ""fully vaxxed"". The WHO has previously recommended that people with fully vaxxed records should consider wearing face masks and practicing social distancing, so it is possible that they are referring to people with fully vaxxed records against COVID-19. However, this contradicts the advice of many public health experts, including the CDC and FDA, who say that people with fully vaxxed records against COVID-19 do not need to wear a mask or practice social distancing. Furthermore, it is possible that the WHO is referring to people who have received some but not all of the COVID-19 vaccines, since many people who have received COVID-19 vaccines do not yet have antibodies against the virus, and it is possible that those people will still be at risk of COVID-19. Finally, the WHO's recommendations are not binding in many countries, and some people distrust the WHO because of their previous misstatements about the pandemic, so it is possible that this situation will cause people to struggle with uncertainty and lead to them not trusting the WHO in the future.

I also think that it is important to trust the WHO, since they are a well-respected organization that has been accurate in the past.

In this case, the WHO recommended that people should go back to wearing masks and social distancing because of the Delta variant. This is because the Delta variant can spread between people more easily than other types of the COVID-19 virus, and so the WHO wants to take precautions against it.

However, I do think that it is important to be cautious and follow all of the recommendations, even if you are fully vaccinated. The vaccine only protects against the virus' most basic forms, and so it does not protect you against all of the mutated forms of the virus that may appear in the future.

Additionally, I think that it is important to be respectful of other people's opinions. Some people may not trust the WHO anymore because of how they have handled other situations in the past. However, I think that it is important to respect other people's opinions and not judge them too quickly.",8,"The WHO said that even fully vaxxed people need to go back to masking and social distancing because of the Delta variant.

The WHO has a mixed track record on whether it warns about dangerous diseases that only affect certain populations, like the US. On the one hand, the WHO did warn about the 1918 flu pandemic, which was specific to unvaccinated populations in the US during a time before vaccines were widely available. On the other hand, the WHO has been criticized for not doing enough to warn about the dangers of Covid-19, even though the virus had already spread to many countries and was causing serious illness and death.

Some people don't trust the WHO anymore because of this history. They think the WHO is too cozy with pharmaceutical companies, and doesn't warn about diseases that affect certain populations. Others think the WHO is too alarmist, and overstates the dangers of diseases like"

The virus could not survive in cold and heat, so it killed a lot of people's immune systems by exposing them to very cold or very hot temperatures. The lack of immunity made a lot of people very sick. The pandemic also exposed how unfair and inequitable our society is, because people with more money could buy more medical equipment and protective clothing, while people who are sicker or poorer had to make due with less. The pandemic also showed how important it is to live close to your family and friends, because if you don't live close to anyone, you're totally alone during this crisis.",0,"The circumstances beyond anyone's control were the pandemic, which is an infectious disease.

1. My mental health has been getting a lot better now that all restrictions are gone in California.

The narrator is familiar with this situation because they have experienced it before in the past.

Furthermore, the country was also one of the first in the world to introduce rigorous measures to contain the pandemic, such as mandatory testing and the wearing of face masks in public places. However, the country then relaxed some of these measures in the later stages of the pandemic, and now, in the fifth wave, the Czechia is experiencing a resurgence of infections.

Czechia, like many other European countries, had already implemented some of the most aggressive testing requirements in the world. It had also enforced very high standards of personal hygiene, including requiring all citizens to wear face masks in public. As a result, the Czechia government was able to significantly reduce the spread of the virus, and only required a few weeks of strict social distancing measures to flatten the curve and allow the country to slowly reopen.

In contrast, other countries, like the United States, had not implemented similar testing requirements or face mask mandates. As a result, the virus spread much more quickly, and the government was not able to contain the outbreak.

However, I recognize that this was a very complex situation, with many factors contributing to the Czech response, and I certainly don't want to blame the government for the problems we had.

To me, the most disappointing part of the crisis was the election-related decisions that were made in the last few months of the pandemic. I am a firm believer in the power of vaccines, and I was very worried that the populists would use the pandemic as an excuse to roll back mandatory vaccines. Fortunately, we were able to avoid this by enforcing the mandates and paying testing sites more, but the damage had been done.

I also think that the Czech government made some bad decisions regarding the handling of the Croatian border crisis on Friday. We were one of the last countries to lift the mask mandates, and we were the only country to not accept refugees from Croatia. This was a bad decision, as many of my fellow Czechs felt that we were abandoning our European",7,"I think the situation was FAIR, because the Czechia had a lot of problems with people not taking COVID-19 vaccines, populists taking advantage of the situation and making populist decisions, and because of the 30% of fully vaccinated people who are ready to put the whole country into lockdown because of people who refuse to take vaccines. The Czechia is a small country and it seems like everyone knows everyone, so it is easy to spread the virus. Also, the Czechia is too expensive for the average Czech, so people are flocking to other countries like Italy and Croatia, which just makes the situation worse.",7,"I think the situation will get worse because the populists are against vaccines and some of them even think that Bill Gates is controlling them. This is a disaster for Czechia because a lot of people in my country are fully vaccinated but there is no mandatory vaccination, so populists will not let us out of the lockdown.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation in Czechia is either ""completely inconsistent"" or ""neither consistent nor inconsistent"" with these norms because they think that cheating during an exam is wrong or cutting a queue is frowned upon by others.

I've been worried about loved ones since the start of this whole thing, and it's been almost a full year since I saw a single family member.

Denmark, on the other hand, has not closed its borders, and is even organizing large sporting events with thousands of people in close proximity. I expected Denmark to be the first in Europe to introduce some sort of lockdown, but instead it chose to follow the Danish model, which is a combination of lockdown, social distancing, and daily life as usual. Denmark has not closed its borders, and people are still traveling between the different regions. The government has not required a test package for the general public, and instead has chosen to rely on self-isolation and contact-tracing for people who show symptoms. The government has also promised financial support to small and medium-sized businesses, and has guaranteed paid leave for people who are affected by the virus. Denmark has doubled its infection numbers, but this could be because of the lack of restrictions on travel and large events, rather than a failure of the policies."
od4pk6,0,NA,7,"I think other people were partially responsible for causing the situation. The narrator believes that OTHER PEOPLE were partially responsible for causing the situation because the text does not make it clear that the other people the narrator references are vaccines. The vaccines are a tool that has been used by other people to help cause the situation, but the text does not make it clear that the narrator believes OTHER PEOPLE were the actual cause of the situation.

The vaccines were introduced into the population and the population developed a natural immunity to the diseases they caused. The text does not make it clear whether the narrator believes that vaccines are a good or bad thing, but it is clear that the narrator is not against vaccines. The narrator believes that OTHER PEOPLE using vaccines to cause a natural immunity is one of the reasons the situation was caused.",7,"The narrator thinks that circumstances beyond anyone's control were responsible for causing the situation because the situation involved the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a highly contagious disease that was first identified in 2019 and which no one could have predicted or fully prepared for.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to cope with the consequences of the event. The event being the pandemic. The narrator is from New Jersey, which at the time was seen as one of the states that was not experiencing the Delta Variant. The narrator has stated that they were lucky that they did not see the kind of explosive growth that other states experienced. They were able to stay stable in terms of cases, and did not see the kind of growth that would indicate the pandemic as a whole was growing. The narrator attributes the stability to the fact that they have an unvaccinated population, which is a large percentage of the population in New Jersey. The unvaccinated population is experiencing the Delta Variant, which is what is driving the growth that other states were experiencing. The narrator hopes that the numbers do go back down, as they would prefer to go forward than go backwards.",7,"The narrator thought that the situation was relevant to their concerns and goals because they were living in New Jersey, where cases of the Delta Variant were stable. The Delta Variant does not seem to be a concern to the narrator, so they did not think that the situation was relevant to them.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation with the vaccines is interesting, but not complicated or dangerous, so they were not needed to attend to it.
However, the situation with the unvaccinated communities experiencing the Delta Variant is complicated and dangerous, so the narrator thinks they needed to attend to it.",0,"I don't think the narrator thought they were able to emotionally cope at all. The NY Times article says that ""the emotional toll has been significant"". The narrator is clearly distraught and struggling with the consequences of the event.",7,"I marked 7 because I feel like the narrator thought they were able to control the situation, but also thought things could have been worse. The reason for the change in the situation is due to the unvaccinated communites who are experiencing the Delta Variant. The narrator believes that they were able to control the situation because they were able to limit the spread of the Delta Variant to their community. However, they still worry that the numbers could have been worse if more people had not gotten vaccinated.",7,"I selected this answer because I feel like the narrator is expressing some level of uncertainty and concern about what is happening. They are clearly concerned about the impact that unvaccinated people are having on the vaccinated people in the community, and their statement that ""those numbers do go back down again"" suggests that they think things will go back to the way they were before the unvaccinated people arrived. However, the narrator also seems to be expressing some level of uncertainty and concern about whether or not OTHER PEOPLE are actually in control of what is happening - they rate the level of ""other people are controlling"" on a scale from 1 to 9, with a rating of 7 indicating that they think other people are controlling ""to some extent"".",0,I don't know how to rate the circumstances controlling the spread of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 to 9.

They believed that they were able to predict because they said they hoped that the numbers would go back down again.,7,"The narrator thinks they are not at all threatened by the change in the number of cases.

For example, the narrator does not believe that failing an exam would cause the number of cases to change.",7,"I think the situation was pleasant because the delta variant doesn't seem to be happening here in New Jersey. The numbers seem to be stable and haven't seen any of the same kind of explosive growth that other places have seen. I'm glad that we were able to avoid going backwards. I hope that the numbers do go back down again though, because I'd hate for us to go backwards. I'd hate for the progress to stop.",7,"I am a little uncertain about the narrator's certainty rating in this case. The NY Times article the text is referencing mentions that cases are ""stable"" and that we have not seen ""the same kind of explosive growth"" that was seen in other countries. Based on this, I would say the narrator is neutral about what is happening in the situation.

However, the article does go on to say that ""fortunately that does not seem to be happening here in NJ"". So it seems the narrator was at least partially confident that the situation in NJ was better than it was in other countries.

I would give the narrator a 7 out of 9 because it is clear from the text that the narrator was partially confident about what was happening in the situation, even if they were uncertain about some of the specific details.",7,"I selected this answer because the situation was consistent with what I wanted. I live in New Jersey, which has had relatively low numbers of cases compared to other states. I'm very happy with that, but I do hope that we see a decline in cases again so that we can go back to normal. I don't want to see our numbers go backwards.",7,I think that the situation was fair. The vaccine was introduced in a reasonable amount of time and with enough warning for people to make an informed decision. The change in behavior does not seem drastic or unexpected. The situation is not completely fair because I would have liked to see the same level of warning and time to make a decision for the vaccine as the one that was given for the CCP. But I understand that it is difficult to predict the future and that the situation would have been unfair to people who made decisions based on the timing of the CCP vaccine.,0,"According to the NY Times this has happened. It's a shocking change of pace considering things were going so well with the vaccines. I guess the reason is because of the unvaccinated communites who are experiencing the Delta Variant. Luckily that does not seem to be happening here in NJ. Cases continue to be stable, and we have not seen any of the same kind of explosive growth. But I DO hope that those numbers do go back down again. I'd hate for us to go backwards.

I'd rate this change of pace as a neutral situation. It's a bit surprising, but not necessarily bad. Cases of the Delta Variant have been stable, which is good. I hope this remains the case.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with my external and social norms since I think cutting a queue is frowned upon.

The narrator has experienced a rise in cases, followed by a stable number, followed by another rise in cases. The reasons for the rise and fall of cases have varied throughout the pandemic, but the narrator has experienced at least one of these variations. The narrator may have found this variation familiar because they have experienced multiple rises and falls in cases before.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation because the situation involved a change in direction of the situation's trajectory that the narrator was not able to control.,7,"This situation was challenging to me because I felt like I was being pressured to make a decision I wasn't entirely comfortable with. On one hand, I definitely saw the benefits of getting vaccinated, and I knew that vaccines had helped prevent a lot of serious diseases in the past. On the other hand, I also knew that there were a lot of people who were skeptical of vaccines and that not getting vaccinated could put me at risk.

The wedding will be in a large public space, and the narrator notes that there will be unvaccinated and unmasked individuals present. The narrator also notes that they live in an area with low vaccination rates and mask usage, making it likely that some of the individuals at the wedding will be unvaccinated and unmasked.

The narrator describes feeling anxious about attending a wedding with a large group of people, but doesn't describe any specific concerns that would cause this anxiety. The only reference to potential risk to the narrator is the possibility that some people at the wedding would be unvaccinated or unmasked, and the fact that the J&J vaccine has an unclear effectiveness against delta. However, the wedding is in August, which is a time of the year when many people get vaccinated and wear masks. Even if some people at the wedding were unvaccinated or unmasked, the narrator doesn't describe any reason to think this would cause them harm. In fact, the wedding is likely to be a low-risk situation for the narrator, and the anxiety they describe is out of proportion with the risk.

In the end, he is just worried about being exposed to the virus and getting sick, which he may or may not actually get.",7,"I rate the narrator as being 7, because although they expressed clear anxiety about the situation, they were clearly uncertain about many aspects of it.

They also expressed concern that there wouldn't be enough masks for everyone, but weren't sure if this was definitely the case. They also expressed concern that the J&J vaccine might not be effective against delta, although they were fairly certain about this.

Additionally, they mention that they have been applying ointment to their skin because their skin has been breaking and cracking, which could be a result of over-sanitizing and over-washing.

I want the government to take drastic measures in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, I also do not want to be forced to take a test or be treated as a suspect just because I live in a different state than the person taking the test. I want to be able to travel freely between states without worrying that I may spread COVID-19 to someone who does not have access to the vaccine. I want to be able to eat out at restaurants without risking exposure to COVID-19, but I also do not want to be charged an exorbitant amount for a test if I am vaccinated.

The narrator is a grocery store employee, and they work in a high-traffic environment, so it's not surprising that they were concerned about the spread of COVID-19.

In this case, I would mark the COVID situation as 7, as I personally find it inconsistent now, but I believe that in the future, governments will need a way to test the vaccinated to protect the public's health, which is inconsistent with my personal value of not killing animals for food.",7,"I find it likely that my state would take extreme measures to protect its citizens, at the expense of its neighboring states. The situation is very serious, and although the risk of contracting COVID-19 is low for a vaccinated person, the risk is still there. Mandating expensive tests for the vaccinated is a way to try and stop the spread of the virus, even if it means destroying the economy in the process. The risk of spreading the virus to others and causing a serious outbreak is a real concern for any government, but especially for those with a history of electing authoritarian leaders."

The itchiness of the narrator's forearms one week after receiving the Pfizer vaccine is not known to the narrator.,7,The narrator thought that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because they were unable to reverse the outcome of the situation to get back what was originally present (e.g. the death of a loved one).,7,"The situation was familiar to the narrator because they had experienced the same situation before with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The narrator had experienced a severe allergic reaction after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, and therefore had developed a lot of anxiety prior to their second dose.",7,"The narrator thought that no effort was needed to deal with the situation in which they had a severe allergic reaction to the first dose of Pfizer's vaccine. The narrator stated that they had a few fear, such as whether or not they would experience a severe allergic reaction with the second dose of the vaccine, and whether they would suffer from myocarditis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the heart muscle.

The narrator had a severe food allergy and was concerned about potential side effects from the Pfizer vaccine. Fortunately, she had no severe allergic reactions from the vaccine, but she is still concerned about potential side effects from the second dose. Her reasoning is that she developed a skin reaction approximately one week after the first dose, which could be related to the vaccine. She also is worried about potential side effects from myocarditis, which is a rare but serious condition that could lead to heart failure."

But if you look at the news from the past, they always said that there is no vaccine yet and that we have to live with the pandemic. They also don't mention anything about herd immunity, which is a natural phenomenon that happens when enough people have the virus and build up an immunity to it that the virus can no longer spread easily. They always say that we are close to herd immunity, but I don't think they are being truthful. I think they are just trying to keep people in fear so that they keep following their rules and don't question the situation. I think they are just trying to create another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine, but I don't think they will ever be able to create one that works against all variants.

The text does not state what the narrator knew before stating that the guy fainted, so it's not possible to determine if the narrator was certain the guy fainted before stating that he learned that the guy fainted.",7,"The narrator thought the situation was completely consistent with what they wanted. They said that they were angry because they thought that people didn't wear masks indoors, which led them to believe that they might have been exposed to the virus. However, it turned out that the guy behind them fainted because of a heart attack, and the COVID tests came back negative.",7,"I think the situation was fair because the guy didn't wear a mask even though he was in a situation where he could have caught COVID. He did not take any actions to protect himself, and he passed the virus to the narrator. However, I think the narrator should have worn a mask regardless of whether or not the situation was fair. The narrator is very angry, and I think they are justified. However, the narrator could have protected themselves by wearing a mask, and this would have protected others as well. Wearing a mask would have also protected the narrator from getting COVID, which would have protected the hospital staff and other patients, and potentially saved lives.",8,"The situation could have gotten worse because the guy who fainted could have had a more serious condition than just the COVID-19. On the other hand, it could have gotten better because he could have just had a simple fever. It was not clear from the text.",7,"The situation was consistent with the external and social norms. Cheating during an exam is wrong, so the narrator thinks this is completely consistent. The fact that someone fainted in a film workshop is very surprising and the narrator is worried that this might be related to COVID, so this is also completely consistent.",7,"The narrator thought that something had been lost in the situation because they were exposed to COVID and without a COVID vaccine, they have no way to know for sure that they have been infected. The narrator was also very angry because they felt like they had been lied to about the safety of the situation and now they have to wait several weeks to get their COVID-19 shot, during which time they could potentially be infected and not know it.",7,The narrator thought that the situation was familiar because they had experienced something similar before. The specific situation that the narrator was referring to is when the guy sitting behind them fainted and they took him to the ER.,7,The narrator thought that: No effort was needed,7,"This situation was challenging because I had to make a quick decision (should I get my COVID jab or not). I was also worried that I might get the jab and then the shot would be useless because I had already had the COVID. I was also angry because I felt like the guy who fainted might have been embarrassed that he was exposed to COVID and didn't take proper precautions. I was also frustrated because I had to wear a mask all the time, even though I didn't feel sick.",7,The narrator thinks that the situation was consistent with their personal values because they are a vegan and the situation doesn't involve killing animals for food.,7,"The situation was completely expected. The narrator said that people didn't wear masks indoors, and that he was surprised no one else wore masks."
oh05p1,7,"I don't think the narrator thought they were completely responsible, probably an 7. The pandemic started because of a virus that leaked from a lab, and it spread because of human error. The world was not prepared for a pandemic, and the response was slow. The world was also not prepared for the variants that emerged, and that's on the Pfizer CEO. The pandemic has a lot of human cost, and the pandemic is still not over. There are no treatments for the variants that have emerged, and that's on the world's lack of research.",7,"I think other people are responsible for causing the situation in two ways. First, I think that the government was slow to react to the pandemic, and did not take it seriously enough, which allowed the virus to spread and infect many people. Second, I think that people who did not take the pandemic seriously and continued to go to crowded events, such as concerts and conferences, were responsible for spreading the virus to a large number of people.",0,"I don't think circumstances were completely responsible for the narrator's situation, because the text mentions that they were trying to get a treatment that was being tested for another disease, and that the scientists were testing vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine for covid.

They were afraid that they wouldn't be able to live with the consequences, so they didn't try to control it.",7,"The narrator thinks that other people were controlling what was happening to him because he believes that there is no treatment for the Delta variant of COVID-19 and that the pandemic will last for a long time, so people need to ""live with covid"" and learn to ""live with fibrosis lungs"". He also thinks that people are not honest about the risks of the vaccines because they want to sell more of them.",0,"I don't know how to answer this question. I think that circumstances were both controlling and not controlling at the same time. I mean, I think that the pandemic was completely luck, because if the virus would have spread in another way, like by airplane, or by human contact, or by something else, then it would have been much more serious. But at the same time, I think that the way that the people reacted to the pandemic, with staying at home and avoiding big events, was also completely controlling, because then the hospitals couldn't handle the number of patients.",7,The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation.,7,"The narrator thinks that they are being threatened, but not by a physical threat (e.g. a dangerous animal nearby).

However, he or she is hopeful that the UK will develop a treatment to make the COVID-19 infection more tolerable.",7,"I don't know what the narrator wanted, but I feel like they were completely inconsistent with their thoughts and feelings. In the text, the narrator expressed that they were tired of hearing about vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, and were instead focused on vaccines and treatments for other diseases. The narrator also expressed that they were scared of the Delta variant, and that they were moving to the UK soon. Based on these pieces of text, it is clear to me that the narrator was completely inconsistent with their thoughts and feelings.",7,"I think the situation is fair because people who live in the UK are not eligible for COVID treatments because they are not eligible for NHS treatment. The same is true for people who live in developing countries. The people who will benefit the most from treatments are the ones who can afford it. Also, since there is no treatment, there is no way to know how effective the treatments are. We don't know if people who are treated are just getting better because they are very sick, or if the treatments are actually working.",0,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator is scared and believes that the situation would get worse in the UK with the Delta variant raging. The narrator is also scared of getting COVID in the UK and believing that there is nothing that can be done to prevent permanent lung damage.

They think that if they get COVID-19, there's nothing they can do to save their lungs from fibrosis.",7,The narrator thinks that the situation is familiar because they think that they have experienced a similar situation in the past. The specific situation that the narrator is referring to is a pandemic. The pandemic is similar to other situations because the narrator has experienced another pandemic in the past.,7,The narrator thought that a lot of effort was needed because they were afraid of the Delta variant.,7,I rate the situation as challenging because I feel like I'm learning new things every day and I'm constantly changing my opinions in response to new information.

I also feel like I'm challenged because I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve my situation and the situation of others.,7,"I personally think the situation is completely consistent with my personal values, because I think it's completely inconsistent to want to avoid hospitalization and damage to my lungs but at the same time support the killing of animals for food.",8,"I was completely surprised by this situation. Even though I've been following the Covid news closely, I was expecting a vaccine to be found by the time the pandemic started. We have millions of dollars spent on vaccines, and all our energy and time has been put into that. I feel like we were all so focused on this goal that we didn't see the obvious consequences coming."

A rating of ""7"" could be interpreted as ""the narrator thought they were able to control this to some extent"", or ""the narrator thought they were unable to control this situation"", or ""something in between"". The narrator did not provide any further context for the rating, so it is not possible to tell what the rating is based on.",0,"I was very surprised by this answer given the circumstances, so I checked the answer box for ""NA"" to indicate that I need more context. The text does not explain why the other person(s) were not allowed to be vaccinated. It only mentions that they ""wont get vaccinated (not CDC approved we live in Canada)"". I think it would be helpful to know if the other person(s) had a medical condition that prevented them from being vaccinated, or if they were simply choosing not to get vaccinated for philosophical or religious reasons. If the latter, I think it's likely that the other person(s) would be controlling their own health and wellbeing, so a rating of 9 would be an appropriate answer. If the former, then the other person(s) may be at risk, and the risk may be out of the narrator's control.",7,"I think the circumstances beyond anyone's control were controlling because my boyfriend is fully vaccinated and the person who doesn't want to get vaccinated is not, Community spread is extremely low near me and my city averages ~20 cases a day.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next because they were able to predict the potential risk that their boyfriend would be exposed to if he went to hang out with this person who was unvaccinated.

So, in this case, I view the situation as neutral.",7,"I think the situation is fair, because the risk of getting COVID-19 from this person is low, and my boyfriend is fully vaccinated.",0,I believe the situation would get worse because the unvaccinated person is putting my boyfriend at risk of getting a disease that is extremely low in my community and globally.

Cheating during an exam is right, cutting a queue is wrong. This person is fully vaccinated with Pfizer, but doesn't want to get COVID-19 vaccinated. This is completely against the social norms.",7,"I think something irretrievable has been lost in this situation because the narrator thought that something has been totally lost in the risk of the boyfriend getting infected with something irretrievable lost in the death of a loved one. The death of a loved one is irretrievable and cannot be brought back, so the risk of losing someone irretrievable is something that was totally lost in this situation.",7,I'm not sure why this situation was familiar to me. I guess I've just had this question before and don't remember why this situation was familiar to me. I would say that this situation was familiar to me because I've had this question before and I know that I've had this question before.,7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed because the situation required them to vaccinate their boyfriend against a virus that was extremely low risk in the area they were in.,7,"This situation was challenging because I was worried about my boyfriend who was exposed to a risk factor that was not considered when he was vaccinated. I was also worried about the friends who did not take proper precautions and were exposed to the same risk as my boyfriend. I was also worried about the risk of the situation for my boyfriend since the community spread of COVID-19 is low where I live, but my boyfriend is still exposed to people who may be infected. I was also worried about my own health since I touched my boyfriend a lot while he was holding the cup to his mouth as he drank. I was also excited to learn that I can now donate plasma because I was able to give plasma myself a few months ago, and it helped my friend who was also donating plasma.",7,"My boyfriend is seeing some friends tonight and I just found out that one of them doesnt want to get vaccinated (not CDC approved we live in Canada) and they are hanging out indoors. My boyfriend is fully vaccinated with Pfizer. Is there much risk for him? Community spread is extremely low near me and my city averages ~20 cases a day.

They're not sure if this is a good idea, but they're not willing to take any risks. The friend will get his second shot a few days before, but the narrator is more concerned about this than the friend.

The second shot is meant to be administered after a month, but this person will get it a few days before my last shot.

They also said that they are concerned that their friend will get their second COVID-19 vaccine shortly before they meet, but that they are not concerned at all because their friend has ""contact with people at his job"" and so they are not concerned about potential COVID-19 exposure from this.

In fact, she is even worried that the group might still be in violation of Covid-19 prevention measures, as the event is still scheduled to take place at the end of July, unless the Covid-19 pandemic escalates and becomes more serious.

The pandemic also required individuals to make difficult decisions and take actions that impacted their daily lives, such as cancelling travel plans and spending time indoors.

The physical threat is obvious - the pandemic is a dangerous virus that can cause serious illness and even death.

The non-physical threat of the pandemic is the fear of failing an exam or losing a potential opportunity because of the pandemic. For example, the narrator is from the Upper East region, which is one of the regions that has been largely unaffected by the pandemic. However, the Upper East is likely what is referred to as a ""hotspot"", which is a region with a high number of cases of the virus.

I think that this is a very natural reaction to a situation this unprecedented, as we are all still learning about this virus and how to protect ourselves and our loved ones. I have been trying not to pay attention to it (but I haven't really been succeeding), but it IS alarming that there are cases rising in the Southern states. However, I do believe that this is a necessary evil, as it is likely that the Upper East is not the only region that this virus will spread to, and it is likely that this will be a global pandemic.

However, I will attempt to answer the question as best I can based on the information given.

I believe that other people were not controlling the narrator's feelings because the narrator says that she felt ""paranoid and stressed"" from ""this whole thing"". I assume that ""this whole thing"" refers to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a global crisis that has caused many people to become paranoid and stressed.

I believe that other people were controlling the narrator's feelings because the narrator says that she felt ""guilty"" about not giving a shit about the delta variant. I assume that the delta variant is a mutation of the novel coronavirus that causes less severe symptoms in some people than the original virus. The narrator does not say that she feels guilty about anything else related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, she does not say that she feels guilty about wearing a mask, which she says gives her a feeling of security.

I felt like other people were not taking COVID-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) seriously and that this could cause a global pandemic.

I was right to be scared. Other people were not taking this seriously and/or did not care, as shown by the lack of social distancing and the low number of tests.

I think the reason they thought they could control the situation was because they were convinced that the numbers were low, and that the vaccination rate was high. The text does not explain why the narrator thought these things were true, but I think the narrator meant that they were aware of the current COVID-19 situation in NJ, and believed that the numbers were low because the testing was limited. The vaccination rate was high because they had received multiple doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and some people had even received a COVID-19 vaccine within the last 12 months. The narrator was probably also aware that the population of NJ was considerably higher than Mississippi and Arkansas, and that a large percentage of the population had been vaccinated.

However, the fact that they are worried about the infected person and are looking for facts to reassure themselves is a testament to the fact that they feel helpless in the situation.",0,"I answered 9 because I felt other people were not at all controlling the situation. The narrator exposed himself to a high risk of getting Covid-19, because he was in close contact with a person who tested positive.

The CDC does not require self-isolation for people who have been exposed to COVID-19 if they have received a vaccination, so I was not sure what to do. I was also worried about the consequences of self-isolating if I was infected with COVID-19, since I have a pre-existing condition that makes me more susceptible to serious illness from the virus. I was also struggling with the decision about whether to tell my employer that I had been exposed to COVID-19, since I was worried that they would think I was sick and try to keep me from working. In the end, I decided to tell my employer that I had been exposed, but the CDC does not provide guidance about what to do if you have been exposed and the employer does not provide paid sick leave, so I was still at work with a mask on.

This could be a result of a number of factors, including the fact that both states have large populations of unvaccinated people, the lack of widespread testing for the virus, and/or a less rigorous approach to social distancing and hygiene. However, both states have also taken more aggressive measures than other states, including closing schools and non-essential businesses, and have had more cases connected to COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities.

There are many ways that the current situation could be considered fair. For example, the number of cases in each state could be determined by the population of the state. However, I do not believe this is the reason the narrator gave for this rating. The narrator may have given this rating because the number of cases in each state is not proportional to the number of people in each state. However, this is not because of any bias towards one state over another.

However, the number of cases seen in the winter are significantly higher than those seen in the summer and fall, because many people who were infected during the summer and fall became immune to the virus, and thus are no longer contagious, but still carry the virus and can pass it on to others. The winter surge is what allows the number of cases to go from relatively low to high, and then relatively high to low as the summer and fall spread further and further apart. However, the narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost because the number of cases in both New Jersey and New York have not reached the levels seen during the winter, and thus something that could have been immune to the virus was susceptible and could have passed the virus on to others, potentially leading to a resurgence of the virus and more deaths.",7,"I think the situation was familiar because, like I mentioned, both New Jersey and New York's rate of transmissions both creeked over 1, but the case numbers in both cases are still nowhere near winter surge levels.

The narrator thought that the false negative test results indicate that the narrator's body was able to fight off covid, but that the narrator still might have been infected with covid because the test was false negative. The narrator thought that something irretrievable was lost because the narrator thought that the false negative test results indicate that the body has ""wasted"" resources fighting off the virus, and that those resources could have been used to fight off other infections in the future.",7,I am a double vaxxed and my partner is as well.

I also feel like I was able to take some time off of work to rest and recover. Overall, I feel like I was able to process a lot of new information and experience a range of emotions about it, and I feel like I was able to communicate that to my partner. I also feel like I was able to take some steps to prepare for the future, like getting a second test just in case and thinking about how I would handle a potential job loss situation if my partner got sick and I was responsible for taking care of our child. I feel like I was able to handle the situation well overall, but I also feel like there was a lot going on, and that this situation might be challenging for someone else in different ways.",7,I think this situation is completely consistent with my personal values because I am a vegan and I don't kill animals for food.

They also mention that they have ""a toddler"", and that ""the world seems a lot scarier for me to bring my child out there"". The narrator also describes feeling like they are ""fully vaccinated"", and that they have ""been since mid May"".

They haven't been able to tolerate a mask due to sensory issues - so they have only been to essential dr appointments.

The situation of not being able to attend outdoor farmers markets or go into a store due to the COVID-19 pandemic was complicated because there were many unknowns and risks involved, such as whether the toddler would tolerate a mask or whether the maintenance or contractors would need to wear masks. The situation was also interesting because the narrator was able to share their perspective on how other parents were navigating this difficult situation, and I felt like I was able to learn something new and gain a better understanding of the challenges that other people faced.",7,"I'm not sure how I feel about this answer, but I'll try to explain. The narrator describes how they have been completely unable to cope with the situation, and I feel like this is a very accurate reflection of their current state of mind. However, I don't think that this is a permanent state of mind, and I think that with time and effort, they will be able to emotionally cope. The reason I say this is because the narrator describes how they have been avoiding going out and interacting with the world, because the world ""seems a lot scarier for them"" than it used to. I think that the narrator is implying that they are starting to emotionally cope, because they are starting to interact with the world again, by driving past busy ice cream places and crying when they see people without masks. I think that the narrator will eventually be able to emotionally cope, because they are starting to interact with the world again, and that this is a temporary state of mind.",0,"I don't know the narrator's thoughts on this matter, so I can't rate their perception of their ability to control the situation.",0,"I am not sure how I would rate other people in this situation.

The narrator thinks they were able to predict that they would have a toddler. The narrator thinks they were able to predict that their toddler would have sensory issues and would have trouble tolerating a mask. The narrator thinks they were able to predict that the mask wouldn't last more than a few days because they said that the situation was evolving into a state of panic.

However, I cannot determine whether the mother is certain or uncertain about anything in the text.",7,"I think the situation was completely consistent with what I wanted. I wanted to be fully vaccinated because I feel it provides me with a higher level of safety and security. I also wanted to be able to start going to outdoor farmers markets and being in stores again because I felt this would help me ease back into life and existence. I didn't want to go out and see everyone without masks close together because I feel it increases the risk of disease and infection, and I don't want to expose my child to that risk. I also don't want to expose him to the normalcy of life passing by and us just sitting here, doing nothing, because I feel this is also inconsistent with what I want.

I don't know what the narrator was expecting, but the narrator's expectations weren't met. The narrator wanted to be able to go to outdoor farmers markets, but the narrator's husband is fully vaccinated and doesn't have an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Therefore, the narrator and her husband are not allowed to go to outdoor farmers markets. The narrator wants to be able to take her child to essential doctor's appointments, but the child is unvaccinated and the child cannot tolerate a mask, so the child cannot be protected from COVID-19 when the child is with the narrator for the essential doctor's appointments. Therefore, the narrator and her child are not allowed to go to essential doctor's appointments. The narrator wants to be able to go to a busy ice cream place, but the narrator's apartment does not have a way for the narrator and her child to be protected from COVID-19 while the narrator and her child are in the ice cream place, because the ice cream place has customers, and the customers do not have masks, so the customers are not protected from COVID-19. Therefore, the narrator and her child cannot go to the ice cream place.",7,"I think the situation would get worse because I am feeling more and more isolated and scared every day, and the lack of normalcy is starting to take a toll on my mental health.

The intent of these recommendations and mandates is to reduce the spread of the virus, which has infected over 6 million people and caused more than 400,000 deaths worldwide as of March 2023. However, because of how easily the virus spreads between people, the use of face masks alone is not enough to prevent all infections. The effectiveness of face masks depends on the effectiveness of the social distancing measures that are being implemented across countries, and the regularity of mask variants indicates that there is not yet a standard for what a mask should look like. The lack of a standard for face masks makes it difficult to achieve the social distancing needed to prevent the virus from spreading.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with the situation because the situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to address.,7,"The situation is challenging because I feel hopeless and there's just gonna be more and more variants of masks.

I am fully vaccinated because I want to prevent the possibility of getting sick. I do not expect the schools to require masks or social distancing again this year.

However, I am worried because I have seen the current situation with COVID-19 and I do not want to get sick. I do not want to miss out on high school because of a virus. I do not want to miss out on prom because I do not want to risk getting sick in a crowded room.

I think it's hard to say whether circumstances were or were not responsible. It's possible that someone could rate the circumstances as highly responsible and someone else could rate them as not at all responsible. I think it's more useful to think about what the narrator thinks about the circumstances. If the narrator thinks that the circumstances were completely responsible, that would rate an 8 on the scale. If the narrator thinks that the circumstances were not at all responsible, that would rate a 1 on the scale. But I don't think either of those ratings are useful. I'm not sure how to interpret them. Maybe you could tell us more about what the narrator thinks about the circumstances?",7,The narrator thinks they were able to cope with the consequences of the event,7,"I rate the situation as being relevant to my concerns and goals. The FDA should require all flu shots to be effective because otherwise it is irresponsible to make people who have a flu shot choose between getting the flu shot and staying home from work to avoid getting sick. The flu can cause serious illness and even death, and it is very likely that the current vaccine is not effective against the upcoming strain of the flu. If the FDA does not require the current vaccine to be effective, people who have the flu shot will be at increased risk of getting sick from the flu, and this could lead to serious problems, such as people being unable to work from home when they are sick.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation is interesting, and that they need to pay more attention to it to deal with it. The situation is interesting because it's a good example of how the current lack of regulation can lead to problems. The FDA is not requiring everyone to get vaccinated, which leaves the population vulnerable to a large number of people who don't want to get vaccinated for religious or medical reasons. The population is therefore vulnerable to a large number of people who can spread a virus unchecked.

The FDA requiring everyone to get vaccinated would certainly prevent unvaccinated people from spreading the virus, which is a good thing. However, the FDA does not have the power to just require everyone to get vaccinated - other people would control that. For example, if the unvaccinated people thought that the FDA was too harsh on people who needed to get vaccinated, other people would reject the FDA's actions as being too harsh on them.

The reason for the low rating is that the narrator thinks that it is still too early to say that the situation is pleasant, because the number of infections is still high, and many people are not vaccinated. The narrator also thinks that it is difficult to require everyone to get vaccinated, because there are people who have medical conditions that prevent them from getting vaccinated, and there are also people who are religiously opposed to vaccination.",7,"I am not sure if I understand the question. The narrator is an AI model, so it can't ""understand"" anything in the general sense. However, I can tell you what the model was trained on, and what its performance has been tested on, so let's use that as a proxy for understanding. The model was trained on a large corpus of text, and its performance has been tested on another large corpus of text. In both cases, the model was able to perform well at predicting whether a given statement was likely to be true or false based on the surrounding text, but it was not trained on enough data to perform well on all questions about the content of the text (e.g., whether a particular person was unvaccinated, or whether a particular action was performed by a person unvaccinated). In general, the model does a good job of predicting whether a statement is likely to be true or false, but it does not do a good job of predicting whether a statement is true or false, given that the statement is true. In other words, the model is not certain about anything, because it has not been trained on enough data to be certain about anything.",7,"I think the situation was somewhat consistent with what I wanted, because the Delta variant is surging and almost all cases are linked to the unvaccinated.

The narrator believes that the unvaccinated should get vaccinated because it is important, not because the FDA requires it. The FDA should require the vaccine because it is important, and because it can protect the public even if the unvaccinated make it hard for the rest of us to access public spaces.",1,The FDA requiring those who receive certain types of federal funding to get vaccinated is not the same as the FDA requiring everyone to get vaccinated. The former policy allows for those who cannot afford the vaccine or who have valid religious objections to not get vaccinated.

The FDA requiring a vaccine for a virus that is currently spreading implies that the narrator has experienced this situation before in the past.,7,The narrator thinks that very much effort is needed to deal with the situation because the unvaccinated make it hard for the rest of us to get vaccinated.

They want to wait until they have confirmation from an expert, so they research the topic and come to the conclusion that the advice is consistent with what they want. We can see that the situation was very consistent with what the narrator wanted, because they researched the topic, found the advice consistent with what they wanted, and acted accordingly.",7,"The narrator thinks the situation was fair because the situation described was not related to any personal experience or knowledge, and thus had no basis for being unfair.",0,"The narrator thought the situation would get worse because the inflammation the article was talking about could get worse over time.

Some of these patients have had to be placed on ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation), which is an extreme life-support procedure that helps oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.

In light of the recent pandemic, the FDA approved a trial of an investigational treatment for COVID-19, called Delta-CoV, which is administered via an intranasal spray. This treatment was developed by a biotechnology company that I work for, and I was one of the participants in the clinical trial.

However, she was surprisingly open to considering the possibility of vaccinating her children. I decided to do some research on my own to put her in the right mindset.

I found the following articles helpful in convincing her:
1. mRNA changes your DNA: The vaccine is made from modified mRNA, which is a genetic material that can be used to deliver a person's own DNA to their cells. This means that the DNA from the vaccine will be processed by the person's own cells, which will think it's their own DNA. This will result in the person's own immune system producing antibodies to fight the virus.
2. mRNA not adequately tested: The mRNA vaccine has been in development for over 20 years, and there are currently over 1,000 clinical trials being conducted around the world. This means that the vaccine has been tested adequately.
3. mRNA long-term effects: The mRNA vaccine is made of modified genetic material, which means that it will be processed by the body just like any other genetic material. This means that the body will produce antibodies to fight the virus for the long"

Specifically, the COVID isolation was very challenging due to being away from my friends and family, not being able to do normal activities, and feeling like I was missing out on important life experiences. The pandemic situation made it hard to see my friends and family, but also forced me to develop new communication skills (texting and video calling) and forced me to be more independent. The counseling I received helped a lot with my anxiety and depression, but also forced me to be more open about my feelings and thoughts with my counselor. This all combined made for a very difficult year, but I think it made me stronger and more prepared for future situations.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation was completely consistent with their personal values because they are a vegan, and the food they were eating was not coming from animals.",7,"I expected the pandemic to occur. The narrator claims they almost died from COVID, but then went on to state that they almost died from a different virus (Delta variant).

The situation described requires the narrator to attend to it further in order to understand the severity of the situation. The situation is complicated by the fact that the narrator is caring for both their elderly grandfather and their sibling who has 19 years on the narrator, and both of these people have health issues that put them at risk of catching the virus. The situation becomes even more complicated by the fact that the narrator is also caring for their mother who has diabetes and heart problems, and the narrator themselves has autoimmune diseases and chronic health issues. The situation is dangerous because the virus is very dangerous and can cause serious health issues for people who get it, and there is currently no vaccine or treatment.

I think the reason why I am feeling this way is because I am comparing this current situation to how things were before the pandemic.

- not comparing this current situation to how things were before the pandemic

In the past, my partner was the primary caregiver, and he had to learn how to be a parent again after having spent several years as a working professional. This time around, we were both still working full-time jobs, so it was even more challenging to manage.

However, we're both optimists, and we feel like this experience has made us stronger as a couple. We're now more patient and understanding with each other, and we've learned to communicate more effectively. We've also learned to delegate more effectively, so that each of us can spend more time with the children.

This experience has made us more aware of how important it is to put our children's needs ahead of our own. We've learned that it's okay to ask for help and that it's better to ask for help than to suffer in silence. We've also learned that it's okay to make mistakes, and that it's better to admit when we're wrong and try to fix the problem rather than pretending that everything is fine when it's not.

We've also learned that it",7,"My personal values are that I don't kill animals for food. The situation was completely consistent with my personal values because the patient has high oxygen levels without support and almost one week sick. This means that the patient was probably suffering from COVID-19, and the patient is likely being treated with oxygen. This is because COVID-19 is known to cause respiratory distress, and people who are infected with COVID-19 are likely being treated with oxygen. It is not common for people to have low lung saturation (60-70%) when they have high oxygen levels without support. Therefore, I think this is a good opportunity to share that I am a vegan, because I want to encourage other people to try veganism, which is a healthy lifestyle that doesn't involve killing animals for food. I want to encourage other people to try veganism because a plant-based diet is associated with many health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer.",7,"This is a very common question, and I am not sure how I would rate this situation. I expect that the patient's saturation would be low in the beginning of the hospitalization, but not to the extent that is described in the text.

They believed that they had the resources and knowledge to make the situation better, or at least manageable.",7,"The narrator believes that the situation will get worse until the Delta virus is crushed, so they must do everything they can to help mask the public. The situation is relevant to the narrator's goals because they want the situation to get worse until the Delta virus is crushed.",7,"The narrator thinks that the situation with the virus is complicated, dangerous, and interesting, and thus requires them to pay more attention to it.",7,"The narrator thought that they were able to emotionally cope with the situation.

""I am all for masking vulnerable and kids but why would the mask mandate kill vaccination efforts? If anything it will keep things from getting worse until we get them down. I dont wanna sound like I am all for masking but after I saw todays numbers I fear we may have to in order to crush Delta. I dont doubt the vaccinations but for how much longer until even higher vaccinated areas suffer the same fate? What is happening to Arkansas, Nevada, etc is horrific.""

However, they also acknowledge that they were unable to control the extent to which other people were willing to wear masks, or the extent to which certain areas were able to enforce the wearing of masks.",7,"The narrator believes that OTHER PEOPLE are not controlling what is happening because he believes that the information he has received is that the virus was created as a bioweapon by a corporation and that it is being used by the corporation to control the population. He believes that the people in power, such as the CEO of the corporation, are trying to control the population in order to benefit from the crisis and save their own lives.",7,"The selected scale of 7 is because the circumstances were controlling the situation outside of anyone's control.

What is happening to Arkansas, Nevada, etc is horrific.",7,"The narrator thought that they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation. They believed that they were able to predict because they said that they were trying to explain why they thought that the situation was going to get worse. The narrator believed that the situation would get worse because the number of people who were vulnerable to the virus was larger than the number of tests that were being done, and therefore more people were likely to catch the virus and become infected. The narrator thought that the situation would eventually get so bad that it would have to be contained, and that containment would involve wearing masks to prevent the virus from spreading further.",0,The narrator thought they were not at all threatened.,7,The selected scale is 7 because the numbers that were coming out of some areas that had gone fully or partially Masked were absolutely horrific. The numbers of the dead were through the roof and the number of people that had become infected because of the lack of vaccination was off the charts. This is a situation that was completely unpleasant and could have been completely avoided if the general public had been more willing to accept vaccination.,7,"The narrator was clearly uncertain about what was happening in the situation. The consequences of the situation were not yet known at the time the text was written. Based on the text, it is not clear whether the situation was caused by the mask mandates, or whether the mask mandates were an attempt to crush the vaccination efforts. It is possible that both were happening at the same time.",7,"The narrator believes that the situation is consistent with what they want because they want more people to get sick so that the virus can spread and kill more people, thus making it harder for the government to function. The situation is also consistent with what the narrator wants because they want to crush the economy and keep people home, thus preventing people from going to work and further crippling the economy. However, the situation is not consistent with what the narrator wants because, although they want the virus to spread, they also want everyone to get vaccinated so that the virus does not spread as widely. The narrator's desire to have the virus spread and their desire to have everyone get vaccinated are in direct opposition to one another, and the situation is therefore inconsistent with what the narrator wants.",7,"The situation was fair. The author argues that masking will not stop the spread of COVID-19 and will instead make the situation worse until the population has been exposed to the virus and builds an immunity. He also argues that the death rate from COVID-19 is much lower than the death rate from a natural influenza, so it is not reasonable to prevent people from getting vaccinated in order to prevent the spread of the virus.",9,"Based on the text provided, it is unclear how the narrator felt that the situation would change due to the mask mandate. The text does not mention anything about the mask mandate, so it is unclear how the narrator would feel about this policy change. The text does mention that some people are concerned that the situation will get worse, but it is unclear how the narrator would feel about this concern. The text does not mention anything about how the situation is currently changing, or what the narrator's predictions are for the future. Therefore, it is unclear how the narrator would rate the change in situation based on the mask mandate.",7,"The situation was completely inconsistent with what the larger community defines as right or wrong. Cheating during an exam is right, cutting a queue is wrong.",0,The narrator thought that something has been totally lost in the situation. The death of vulnerable populations due to lack of vaccination is irretrievable loss.,7,The narrator believes that the situation is familiar because they have experienced a similar situation in the past. The selected scale of 7 indicates that they believe that the situation was somewhat familiar. The specific situation that they are referring to is not specified in the text.,7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed because the situation required expending a large amount of mental or physical effort to deal with the situation.,7,"The situation was challenging, but I think that I saw an opportunity to develop myself and grow.  I am still learning how to be a good friend and partner, and this situation will help me grow in those areas.  I also think that this situation will help me become a stronger person, by showing me what not to do in a difficult situation.",0,"I don't think the situation is consistent with my personal values because I am all for masking to help vulnerable people. I think that the mask mandate should not kill vaccination efforts because if anything it will help vulnerable people get vaccinated and delay the spread of the virus. I don't want to sound like I am against masking, but after seeing today's numbers, I fear that we may have to wear masks to crush the virus. I don't doubt the efficacy of the vaccines, but for how much longer until even higher vaccinated areas suffer the same fate? What is happening to Arkansas, Nevada, etc is horrific.",8,"The situation was completely unexpected. I expected the COVID situation to improve in the US, with the number of cases and deaths decreasing. However, the numbers continue to increase in some states, even though there are measures in place to prevent the virus from spreading. In addition, some areas that were previously considered low-risk for COVID-19 are now suffering from the virus. This is a very serious situation, and it will have a long-term impact on the US economy."

I would have advised the narrator to reconsider going to this gender reveal party. While gender reveals are fun, they are often associated with a lot of partying and celebration, which could put the narrator at risk of getting COVID-19.

I also think it's important to consider the health of the mother. The mother is pregnant, and given that she is under the age of 35, she is at an increased risk of COVID-19. If she has not been vaccinated, she may not have had time to build up an adequate amount of antibodies.

In summary, I think the narrator has good reason to be worried about COVID-19. Going to this gender reveal party would be inadvisable, and the narrator should reconsider going.

The COVID-19 pandemic was completely unexpected for the narrator, as this is a gender reveal party, and gender reveal parties typically involve large gatherings. However, the gender reveal party in question is for a baby girl, so the likelihood of a pandemic at that party is not surprising. The gender reveal party location of 200 miles from the narrator's home is also not surprising, as many gender reveal party locations are in rural areas that are not well-served by airports or major highways. The COVID-19 hotspot status of the location is also not surprising, as many rural areas in the United States have higher than average numbers of cases of COVID-19."

From the text, it is not clear to me how long the narrator has been struggling with the idea of getting a haircut. However, I will assume that this is a relatively new concern for the narrator, since they mention that they were ""scouting out"" local barber shops when the COVID-19 pandemic first started to impact their daily lives.

Based on the text, it seems like the narrator is struggling with the idea of getting a haircut because they are concerned that they may expose their children to COVID-19. However, it is not clear to me why the narrator believes that COVID-19 and haircuts are incompatible. In fact, I would argue that getting a haircut is an excellent way to prevent the spread of germs, since it is a medical procedure that requires the patient to be in close physical contact with other people.

The only reference to fearing ""regressing into our pre-vaccinated behavior"" is the narrator's statement that ""two to three months of normalcy"" is ""two steps back"". However, the narrator does not explain why they think this is a bad thing. The only reference to feeling ""betrayed"" by the COVID-19 vaccine is the narrator's statement that ""so many unvaccinated people caused this spike"".

I fear that if we wait two to three months for the normalcy to return, we will have regressed back to not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, and will feel like we are back to where we were before the pandemic.

The delta variant is incredibly contagious, but people have different symptoms and the virus can survive on surfaces and objects for a long time. So even though people were exposed twice in the last week, the risk of getting infected is still very high for those who were unvaccinated. And it takes about two to three months for people who were vaccinated to develop immunity. After that, they should be protected from getting infected. In contrast, people who were unvaccinated are at higher risk of getting sick and should take extra precautions, such as wearing a mask. I don't think the situation is unfair because the delta variant causes different symptoms in people who were vaccinated and unvaccinated.",7,"I feel like the situation will get worse because of the following reasons:
1. The narrator is worried that people will go back to not wearing masks and not getting updated vaccines, which will lead to a regression into the pre-vaccinated behavior.
2. The narrator thinks that the death toll and hospitalization rates will skyrocket, which will lead to a decline in mental health across the society.

I also feel like the situation will get worse because of the following reasons:
1. The delta variant is incredibly contagious, but not as severe as the common flu, so the narrator thinks that people will go back to not wearing masks and not getting updated vaccines, which will lead to a regression into the pre-vaccinated behavior.

I am a young adult, and I believe that I have never encountered a situation like this in my lifetime.",7,The narrator thinks they needed to exert some effort to deal with the situation because the delta variant is incredibly contagious but maybe not as strenuous to the healthcare system. The delta variant is a new strain of the COVID-19 virus that causes fewer symptoms than the common strain and can result in infected individuals being asymptomatic or even showing mild symptoms. The narrator thinks that this makes the delta variant more contagious than the common strain but maybe not as strenuous to the healthcare system because infected individuals may not show as many symptoms or may even be asymptomatic.,7,I am worried about our collective societys mental health.

If this is the case, then the people of Delta would have to take on significant debt to rebuild the local economy, and this would leave them vulnerable to future economic crises. On the other hand, if everyone can be vaccinated, then Delta can take advantage of the ""Vaccine Induced Protection"" effect, where people who are vaccinated are protected against the disease, but this doesn't protect people who weren't vaccinated. In this case, Delta can rebuild its economy without incurring significant debt, and this would leave it better positioned to handle future crises.",0,"The selected scale is NA because the text does not address this question.

I don't think it's right to tell someone what they can and can't eat.

I don't know much about animal vaccinations, but I do know that it's important to make sure that animals are healthy. If they are being treated well, then I don't see why they wouldn't want to get vaccinated.

I don't know much about the vaccination situation in India, but I do know that it's important to make sure that everyone is vaccinated.

These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, trap the sun's heat on earth, causing the planet to heat up. This, in turn, has caused global temperatures to rise. Other scientists have predicted this rise in temperatures for decades, and the world has been preparing for the consequences for decades as well. However, because of human behavior, global temperatures have been steadily rising for decades, and now we are seeing the effects. First, there was an increase in the severity and frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts. Then, we started to see changes in the climate that are more difficult to control, such as rising sea levels and changes in the seasons. Now, we are seeing the effects of climate change play out on a global scale in the form of the COVID pandemic. I believe that other people are not responsible for causing this pandemic, because the pandemic is a natural consequence of human behavior, and other people could not have known that human behavior would lead to this pandemic.",0,"I marked this answer as NA because I don't think the text addressed what circumstances were responsible for causing the situation.

However, the narrator could also have gotten vaccinated, and this would have protected them. The narrator could also choose to wear a mask, and this would have protected them.

They believed that once a virus reached ""peak fitness"" it would eventually break the cycle of evolution and would not be able to survive. This is what would break the cycle of reinfection and spread among the unvaccinated.",7,"The narrator thinks that they are being threatened because they don't have herd immunity. Herd immunity is when a large %age of a population has been infected with a disease, such that the disease cannot easily spread through the population. This is because the immune system has seen the disease before, and has built up a memory of how to fight it. Without herd immunity, new variants of the disease can emerge that are more easily spread than the original, because the population hasn't built up an immunity to them. The narrator thinks that they are at risk of not having herd immunity because of the current pandemic. They believe that the current pandemic is spreading very quickly among the unvaccinated, and that this is because the current pandemic is particularly dangerous. They believe that this is because the current pandemic is a new variant that has emerged, and this variant is particularly dangerous because it has evolved to be optimal at spreading through the population without an immune system. The narrator thinks that this variant will continue to spread, and that this will cause the current pandemic to peak, and then eventually start to die down. However, the current pandemic is still ongoing, and the current variant is still dangerous.

The thought that a worse variant could emerge and reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them, is a very plausible scenario. And this is what worries me about going the natural immunity route.",7,"I am not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, I agree with the narrator that herd immunity is a bad idea because it would leave the unvaccinated open to potentially dangerous infections. On the other hand, I don't want to get vaccinated because I don't want to contribute to the spread of Covid. So, if Covid continues to spread unabated, I will be unhappy regardless of whether or not I get vaccinated. However, if Covid is eventually brought under control, I will be happy regardless of whether or not I get vaccinated. So, I am conflicted.",7,"I think the situation is fair. The argument that the narrator presents to doubt if natural immunity could actually help has a weak premise. It's possible for natural immunity to protect against some variants, such as Delta. I don't know if natural immunity actually protects against Delta though, so I'm not sure if the argument the narrator presents to doubt if natural immunity could actually help is valid.

However, the argument that the narrator presents has some merit. If COVID continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it could lead to the emergence of a worse variant, which could lead to the reinfection of those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them. This could lead to a perpetual cycle of each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.",7,"I think the situation would get worse because the narrator is worried that the new variant, if it emerges, would be even worse than the last and could reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spread like wildfire among them.",7,"I am not sure what the EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS are, so I can't rate the consistency of this situation.

The narrator was worried that if we went the natural immunity route, we would just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people.

However, the narrator does think that something irretrievable has been LOST in the situation if they thought that the Covid-19 pandemic would never end. The narrator thinks that Covid-19 will eventually reach ""peak fitness"", and that this will be the breaking point.",7,"I think the narrator is worried that the situation they described is similar to past pandemics, where after a few years, a new, more virulent strain emerges and spreads like wildfire, infecting and reinfecting large numbers of people. The narrator is concerned that this will happen with COVID-19, too, if we don't vaccinate everyone. However, I think the narrator is missing an important factor: evolution. It seems to me that the narrator is worried that the virus will ""peak fitness"" and then decline, just as HIV peaked in the 1980s but has been declining since then. However, it seems to me that the opposite is more likely to be true: that the virus will continue to evolve to become more contagious and deadly, and that this will lead to more cases, more deaths, and more pressure to vaccinate everyone. In other words, I think the narrator is worried about the wrong thing, and the situation is actually FAR more familiar than they realize.",7,"The narrator thinks that effort is needed to deal with the situation because the situation involves a virus that is progressively worse and could produce a variant that is even worse than the previous variant. The narrator thinks that if the situation just keeps repeating itself, it would require a lot of effort to adapt to each new variant.",7,"The scenario described is very challenging, but I think the narrator sees an opportunity to develop themselves and grow. The scenario describes a thought experiment about a virus that evolves to become progressively worse, which the narrator believes would lead to extinction of the virus due to lack of infectivity on the population as a whole. However, the scenario describes a thought experiment where the virus evolves to become progressively worse, but there is a ""peak fitness"" that the virus reaches, after which the virus would no longer be able to infect a large portion of the population. This thought experiment presents an opportunity for the narrator to develop themselves and grow by appreciating the complexity of the system and the role that human behavior plays in shaping the outcome of the scenario.",7,"The narrator believes that the situation is somewhat consistent with the narrator's personal values, as long as herd immunity is actually achieved through vaccination. The narrator believes that herd immunity is a good idea, because it protects those who are unable to be vaccinated (such as infants and the elderly). The narrator also believes that herd immunity is likely to be achieved in the near future, because COVID-19 has a low infectiousness and a high-ish mortality rate, and so the virus will naturally die out if a large enough proportion of the population is immune. The narrator is a vegan, and so they are somewhat concerned about the idea of killing animals for food to achieve herd immunity. However, the narrator believes that this concern is outweighed by the benefits of herd immunity, and so they are willing to compromise.",8,"I was surprised by the possibility of a worse variant emerging. I had not considered the possibility of a worse variant emerging.

I expect the situation to occur. I was not surprised by this possibility."

The narrator thought they were able to predict this because they had already started the process of hiring the COVID-19 narrator.",7,"I selected 7 because the narrator was threatened by the possibility of failing an exam, and by a physical animal nearby (the pandemic). I think the text also indicates that the narrator was threatened by a non-physical animal nearby (the coronavirus), but I marked that as 9 because the text indicates that the narrator was fully vaccinated (which would make it impossible for the coronavirus to be a threat).",7,"I think the situation was pleasant, as I am happy to have a reliable employee and I don't feel guilty about not vaccinating my daughter.",7,"I marked this as 7 because the narrator is clearly aware that the person they are talking about is due to start working again soon, but doesn't know when exactly.

He is due to start working again soon. This is completely consistent with what his community defines as right or wrong. Cheating during an exam is wrong, and so is cutting a queue.",7,The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because they are unable to reverse the outcome of the situation to get back what was originally present (e.g. the death of a loved one).,7,"I am not sure why this situation was familiar to me, perhaps because I work in the healthcare industry or perhaps because I have children myself. The situation itself is not particularly unusual or surprising, but I am still surprised that I felt as though I had experienced this situation before.",7,The narrator thought that very much effort was needed to deal with this situation because the person in question was due to start working with the company again.,7,"I anticipate this situation to be challenging, because I am used to fully vaccinating my dogs, and now I have to explain to this new employee that his daughter is not eligible for vaccination. I also have to find a way to administer the vaccine to the daughter without exposing the rest of the family to the COVID-19, which is a very difficult challenge, because my house is currently empty, and I don't have access to proper equipment or facilities to follow the safety protocols.",7,"This situation is completely consistent with my personal values, as I am a vegan and I don't eat meat. The reason is that killing animals for food is one of the most inhumane acts that humans can commit against each other, and I think it's important to not support this practice.",7,"I was completely surprised by this situation. I expected him to be fully vaccinated, but not his daughter. I expected him to get the job next weekend, but it happened a week later. I expected his daughter to be vaccinated, but she is too young now."
opqo26,0,I don't think the narrator thought they were completely responsible for what happened. They say they were long hauling and my son and I were the worst off for catching Covid. They also say they were scared and didn't know what was happening. So I think the narrator thought they were at least partially responsible.,0,"I don't know how I feel about other people being completely responsible for the narrator's situation. On one hand, the narrator is clearly struggling with her children's Covid symptoms and decisions, so it's possible that her children are responsible for their own situation and that the narrator is not doing her best to support them. On the other hand, the Covid pandemic was a global crisis that impacted everyone, so it's possible that other people are completely responsible for the narrator's situation. I'm not sure how I feel about either possibility, and I'm not sure how the narrator feels about it either.",0,"I don’t think circumstances were at all responsible.

I cannot rate the relevance because I do not know what I am looking for in this situation.,7,"I think the narrator thought that they needed to ATTEND to the situation further because the situation was both complicated and interesting. It involved the narrator's son catching Covid, as well as the narrator and their family having to endure long haul travel, which is known to cause fatigue. The Covid infection can cause severe symptoms such as extreme fatigue and weight loss, which makes it complicated. The long haul travel also caused the narrator and their family to experience a lot of uncertainty and anxiety, which made it interesting.",0,NA,0,"I don't think the narrator thought they were able to control what was happening in the situation. The narrator clearly states that they felt like a horrible mother because they wouldn't let their son go out and do things, because of the COVID risk.",0,"I answered this question with ""NA"" because I do not think the text addressed how I thought other people were controlling the situation.

I think the narrator's son's Covid symptoms were very difficult to live with. I also think the narrator's son and her have different views on getting vaccinated. I think the narrator is torn between her son's wishes not to be at the house and her desire to let him live his life.

I don't think the narrator's son's Covid symptoms were a result of the narrator controlling what happened in the situation. I think the Covid symptoms were very difficult to live with and the son had to make a very difficult decision (to not be vaccinated).",0,"I don’t know the circumstances surrounding this situation, so I can’t rate them.",7,"The narrator thought they were able to predict where this situation was going with respect to their son catching Covid and the family having long haul travel symptoms (fatigue, pass out fatigue, weak, over 30 pounds lost).

These are both relatively unpleasant experiences.",7,"I am not sure if I was completely certain of what was happening in the described situation. I was caught off guard by my son's reaction to the pandemic. I was expecting him to be scared, but not completely unwilling to stay at home with me. I was also surprised that he lost over 30 pounds, even though we were eating very little and he was not able to do much besides sleep and watch TV. I would have liked to understand better what was happening to him, but he refused to see a doctor. I feel like a bad mother because I want to let him go out to get some fresh air and exercise, but I am also worried about him getting Covid again.",7,"I think the situation is completely consistent with what I WANT because I don't want to let go of my son, and I don't want him to leave. I want to keep him around because I feel like a horrible mother because I don't let him go out and do the things that he wants to do. I also don't want him to leave because I feel like I don't know what else to do for him.",7,"I think the situation is completely fair, my son and I both caught covid. We were in different places and he didn't know I had it. I took extreme measures to prevent spreading it to him. I didn't let him go out because the risk of getting it was too high. I didn't want to pass it on to him but I also didn't want to keep him home with me either. I did the best I could with the information I had at the time.",0,"I think the Covid situation would get worse for me because my son and I live in a remote area with limited access to medical care. We would most likely be unable to get tested or treated quickly, which would cause my son's symptoms to become more severe. We would also be at high risk for exposure and infection if we went to the hospital, which would likely cause more people to get sick and further strain the medical system. In summary, Covid would most likely cause a lot of stress and anxiety for me and my family.

I live in a small town in Washington State called Quincy. It is a rural area with very limited access to medical care. The closest large city is Bellingham, which is about a two-hour drive away. The drive to the city is often congested during peak hours, and there is only one hospital in the Quincy area that provides emergency care. Because of this, it is very difficult to get treated or tested for Covid-19 when needed.

I have a 19-year-old son named Ian. He caught Covid along with all of my family back in 2020. We all had mild symptoms at the time, but Ian and I both had very weak symptoms, which concerned us.",7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with social norms, as many people would frown upon cutting a queue or cheating on an exam. However, the narrator is conflicted about letting their son leave the house, as they fear for their safety and that of their son. This suggests that the situation is somewhat inconsistent with the narrator's EXTERNAL AND SOCIAL NORMS.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because they blame themselves for their children's current situation. The narrator also thinks that their son doesn't want to be around them because they are ""the bad mom"" for not letting him leave the house. The narrator's heart hurts because they feel like they are losing their children.",7,"I selected 7 because I feel like this situation is somewhat familiar for me. My son and I were in a similar situation with Covid-19 when I was younger. I caught the virus along with my family, including my mother. We all had the same symptoms, including fatigue, loss of appetite, and weak energy. We also lost over 30 pounds between us. My son and I both had trouble eating and needed to supplement with vitamins. We both had low energy and needed to sleep for over 16 hours in a row in order to function. I also felt weak and passed out frequently. 

I feel like a horrible mother because I was unable to help my son during this difficult time. I was also unable to help my mother who had the virus. I was scared and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to leave the house because I was worried that I would pass the virus on to others. I was also worried that I wouldn't be able to go to work because I was so sick.

The Covid-19 had a high fatality rate at the time, and there was very little information or knowledge about the virus at the time. The narrator and their family members had to rely on news reports and social media for accurate information about Covid, and make decisions about how to protect themselves and others based on that information. The Covid diagnosis and treatment required a lot of effort on the narrator's part, and I think the narrator thought that they needed to exert that effort.",7,This situation was challenging because I feel like a horrible mother for not letting my son go out and socialize despite his Covid symptoms. I also feel bad that he can't eat and has lost over 30 pounds. I don't know what to do at this point because I don't want to force him to stay home and I don't want him to resent me for it either.,7,"The situation is somewhat consistent with my personal values as a vegan and not killing animals for food. My son is 19 and he caught Covid along with my family. My family has been long hauler, so all of us have been exposed to a lot of air droplets and been in close contact with each other. I feel like I should be more consistent with my personal values as a vegan and not kill animals for food, because I feel like I should practice what I preach to my son.

However, I don't think the situation is consistent with my personal values as a respectful person. I don't think I have been respectful to my son. I have been yelling at him a lot recently because I am frustrated with his behavior. I feel like I should practice what I preach to him, and I should be more respectful to him.

I was expecting Covid to only spread through large droplets and contact, not small droplets. I was also completely surprised by the severity of the symptoms that my son experienced. He and my daughter both lost over 30 pounds, and both experienced fatigue like pass out fatigue. We also both experienced extreme weakness.

I feel like a horrible mother because I can't let my son go out in public. We only go to the parks, and even going to the parks turned into a fight because my son wants to do too much. I don't want my son to get sick just because I don't let him go out. I also don't want him to get used to staying home, because that would be even more devastating if he got Covid again.

Please help me figure out what to do. I don't want my son to leave, because my son wants to leave, but my son also blames me because he has nowhere to go. And my daughter is completely silent, and I don't know what to do with her."

The situation was that the husband was concerned about his grandmother passing away and wanting to travel to attend the funeral, but also was concerned that the children did not have any form of protection against COVID-19. The situation was complicated by the fact that the husband was concerned that the children might have COVID-19, but also interested because there had been recent news of people who had been vaccinated for COVID-19 who still tested positive for the virus, so the narrator thought the husband would need to attend to this situation to be able to make an informed decision about whether or not to travel.",0,The narrator thinks that they were not able to emotionally cope with the event,7,"I don't understand what the narrator is asking me to rate.

In that situation, I rate the narrator's control over the situation as a 7. I believe the narrator is able to control the husband's decision to travel to the funeral, but not the funeral itself or the after-effects of the funeral on the family.",7,"I think other people were controlling this situation to an extent of 7 because the narrator is concerned about the risk of COVID to his husband if he travels alone, but the narrator is not willing to wait for the whole family to be vaccinated.

Second, our children are still susceptible to COVID-19, and will be left vulnerable without their grandparents to care for them.

We were able to find a reliable source for a COVID-19 vaccine, and our kids received their shots before we left for the service.

We arrived at the service and were able to self-isolate in a separate room while the service was happening. The service was very long, but we were able to find a babysitter for the kids while we were in a hotel nearby for the night. The next day, we were able to return home and resume our daily lives.

I was wrong.

I also thought I was completely responsible for finding a way to get my children vaccinated. I researched Moderna and Pfizer, and I found a doctor who would write prescriptions without requiring identification or insurance. I was able to get the vaccine this way, but I was very worried about the safety of self-medicating with a prescription written by a stranger, so I did everything I could to make sure the doctor was who they said they were. I verified the doctor's name, address, and phone number, and I even called the state medical board to make sure the doctor was licensed and in good standing.

I was not completely responsible for my situation, because there are many factors outside of my control that contributed to this situation.

On the contrary, there is evidence that the current vaccine is effective, and there is evidence that the current vaccine is not effective. The recommendation to get a booster without sufficient evidence to suggest which booster is appropriate is also very unfair. Finally, the requirement to provide identification or insurance in order to receive a booster is extremely unfair.

So I can't get a vaccine without lying or breaking the law. That's assuming I can even FIND someone who will give me a vaccine without ID or insurance. And even if I do get a vaccine, I'm still at risk for adverse reactions. So in summary, I'm putting my health in the hands of someone who can't make any mistakes.

But here's the thing. I'm not giving up that easily. I'm going to figure out a way to get that vaccine. I'm going to be that person who takes control of their health and gets their vaccines.

Im a bit lost on what I need to do since I dont know what the guidelines are when it comes to contacting covid on the day you get your 2nd dose. Please give me advice on how I should move forward. Thank you.",7,"The narrator thought that they needed to exert some effort to deal with the situation. They didn't specify how much effort, but given that it was related to COVID, it's likely that they thought some effort was needed. They could have tried to contact the COVID hotline on the day they got their second dose of SINOVAC, but it's not clear whether they thought any effort was needed for that.",7,This situation was challenging because I dont know what the guidelines are when it comes to contacting covid on the day you get your 2nd dose.,7,The narrator thought that the situation was completely consistent with their personal values in 7/22/2021 because being a vegan and not killing animals for food doesn't require the narrator to know the guidelines for when to contact COVID.,8,This event was completely unexpected.
oq4c2z,7,"I marked this response as NA because the text does not address the narrator's thoughts on their own responsibility. The text only states that the narrator's mother was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months, and cites the Israeli studies as proof. The text does not state or imply that the narrator thinks their mother is completely responsible for her beliefs.",7,I think other people were somewhat responsible for the situation because my mom only believes vaccines cause immunity to last for 6 months. She has access to the internet and could have found evidence to the contrary.,0,NA,0,"The narrator thought they were unable to cope, as they were morally reprehensible for getting a third shot.",6,"The narrator believes that the situation is morally reprehensible and believes that the other party in the situation is mistaken. The narrator believes that the other party in the situation is mistaken in their belief that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator believes that 6 months is an insufficient amount of time for the immunity from a vaccine to take effect. The narrator believes that the other party is mistaken in their belief that children may need shots by then. The narrator believes that children should receive multiple shots over a longer period of time in order to achieve immunity. The narrator believes that the situation is morally reprehensible because the other party is lying to get a third shot, even though children may need those shots.",7,"The narrator thought that their mom needed to attend to the situation because she was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months and was morally reprehensible for lying to get a third shot. The situation was complicated because the narrator didn't know exactly what studies the mom was talking about, but they thought the mom was referencing the Moderna vaccine, which the narrator knew to be safe and effective. The situation was interesting because the mom's beliefs were new to the narrator and they wanted to understand why she had them. The situation was dangerous because the mom's actions could put the children in danger by exposing them to the flu.",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,"The narrator thinks that circumstances beyond anyone's control were controlling what was happening in the situation. The text does not mention any specific circumstances beyond anyone's control, so the narrator thinks that circumstances were controlling.",0,"The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next. They based this on the assumption that the mom had gotten the moderna shot in March, and was going to claim that she got a third shot in September. The narrator thought that the mom was scared of the delta variant, and was going to lie and go to CVS in September to get a third shot. The narrator was able to predict this because the mom said that she was scared of the delta variant and was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasted 6 months.",0,NA,7,"I think the situation was neutral, because I don't think the narrator's mom' reaction to the situation was reasonable. It's not pleasant to lie to get a free shot, but I don't think it's morally reprehensible either. The situation could have been worse, the mom could have tried to convince her mom to not get the shot, or not get the second shot, which would have been even more morally reprehensible.",7,"I am not certain why the narrator is concerned about their mom's belief that the 6 month immunity from the Moderna vaccine only lasts for 6 months. It is possible that the mom is incorrect in her belief, and that immunity from the Moderna vaccine lasts for more than 6 months. I rate the certainty of the narrator about this belief at 7, as it is possible they are incorrect, but they clearly believe this to be the case.",7,I marked this as 7 because the situation was consistent with what the narrator wanted. The narrator is convinced that their mom is scared from the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator is convinced that their mom is morally reprehensible for trying to get a third shot by September. The Moderna shot the narrator's mom got in March is the only shot the narrator's mom has received so far. The narrator believes their mom is morally reprehensible for lying about not having health insurance in order to get a third shot.,7,"I think the situation is completely unfair. My mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity only applies to Moderna, not other vaccines. There is no evidence for this. In addition, the Israeli studies she cites only show an association between the vaccine and the adverse event. They did not prove that the vaccine caused the adverse event. Furthermore, the adverse event is very rare, and the risk of getting the adverse event from Moderna is very low. I think it is morally reprehensible for her to try to get more shots.",7,"I think the situation would get neutral, because the narrator is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months, but the text does not back this up. The text only states that ""the duration of immunity for some vaccines is uncertain"". The Israeli studies the narrator is citing do not state that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months, but rather that the duration of immunity for some vaccines is uncertain. The text does not state that the duration of vaccine immunity is less than 6 months.",7,"The situation was moderately consistent with the external and social norms. The narrator thinks that their mom's behavior is wrong, but they don't think it's morally reprehensible. They think their mom is just trying to get a third shot because other people do it. The narrator thinks that their mom is scared from the delta variant, so she is taking a irrational stance on this issue. The community thinks that third shots are necessary, so the situation is consistent with what the community thinks is acceptable.",7,"The narrator thinks that something irretrievable has been lost in the situation because the mom is convinced that the 6 month immunity period of the vaccine has expired, and is trying to get a 3rd shot. The mom is convinced that the Israeli studies showing a 6 month immunity period are proof that moderna shots are not effective. The mom is morally reprehensible for trying to get a 3rd shot when children may need that shot by then.",0,I think the situation was not familiar to the narrator because they did not experience this situation before. The situation is that the narrator's mom is scared of the delta variant and is convinced that vaccine immunity only lasts 6 months. The narrator believes that this is not familiar because delta variant is a new variant of the corona virus and that the corona virus immunity lasts for 12 months.,7,The narrator thinks their mom needed to exert effort to deal with the situation because she was convinced that vaccine immunity only lasted 6 months. She cited Israeli studies to bolster her claim. The narrator thinks this is morally reprehensible because children may need those shots by then.,0,NA,0,"I think the situation is completely inconsistent with the values of being a vegan and not killing animals for food. However, I think it is completely consistent with the value of being a respectful person.",8,"I expected my mom to be scared of the delta variant. The delta variant is a very rare strain of the flu, and it's mutations are what cause the flu to become more dangerous and more difficult to treat. The Israeli studies are not a valid comparison, because the delta variant does not exist in Israel. The delta variant was first discovered in a child in the US, and since then, it has spread to over 75% of the population in the US. The population immunity to the common strains of the flu protects us from the delta variant. My mom's belief that the delta variant immunity only lasts 6 months is also not true. It is possible for immunity from the delta variant to last longer than 6 months, but it is very unlikely. The likelihood of my mom's belief occurring is a 9."

Please clarify.",0,NA,0,NA,0,NA,7,"The narrator thinks that this situation is relevant to their concerns and goals because they are studying in France and will soon be vaccinating there. They are concerned about being immunosupressed and close to this situation, their girlfriend needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. The narrator thinks that this situation is completely relevant because of this concern and because they are close to their girlfriend.",7,"I think the narrator in this text needed to attend to the situation further, because it was complicated, dangerous, and interesting. The situation was complicated, because the narrator is studying in France, and they need to take their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The situation was dangerous, because the narrator's girlfriend is immunosupressed, and they are worried that she could get infected with COVID-19 if they are close to each other. The situation was interesting, because the narrator is considering on registering and taking their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico, because France only allows them to get one dose.",0,NA,7,"I don't understand what this question is asking. Are you asking me to rate how much I thought I was in control of the situation? If so, I don't understand what ""control"" means in this context. If I understand the question correctly, are you asking me to rate my level of confidence in my ability to control the situation? If so, I don't understand what ""control"" means in this context. I think ""control"" is a very ambiguous question in this context.",0,"I don't know why the narrator thought that other people were controlling what was happening, but he mentioned that other people were controlling him because of his girlfriend's care. It could be that he was worried that she would get infected if he decided to take a risk and take a second dose of the mRNA vaccine in Mexico, so he was seeking reassurance from others that he was making the right decision.",0,"The circumstances were not controlling. The narrator is a Mexican citizen studying in France. France has a one-dose policy for COVID-19 vaccinations. The narrator was allowed to get one COVID-19 vaccine in December. The narrator is concerned that taking a ""second dose"" of COVID-19 vaccine in Mexico might put him at risk for COVID-19 because France counts his antibodies produced by a previous infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated.",7,The narrator thought they were able to predict what was going to happen next in the situation.,0,NA,1,"I rate the situation as pleasant. Although the narrator is concerned about the risk of getting the COVID-19 infection again, he is in a country that has a very low number of cases at the moment, and he has confidence that he can get tested and be able to return home safely if he does get infected.",7,"The narrator was completely uncertain about what was happening in the situation. The text did not provide enough information about the circumstances, and therefore it was not possible to determine if the narrator was certain or not.

The text did not provide enough information about the circumstances, and therefore it was not possible to determine if the narrator was certain or not.",7,I don't understand what this scale is for.,7,"The situation is completely unfair. The narrator got 1 dose of the mRNA vaccine because of covid exposure in December, even though most countries allow for 2 doses. The decision to only count one dose of the mRNA vaccine is not based on any scientific evidence, and is purely based on France counting the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. The decision to only allow one dose of the mRNA vaccine leaves the narrator concerned about getting a second dose, since mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet, but his parents say he should not risk it because he is fully vaccinated already.",0,I don't understand what this question is asking. Could you please clarify?,7,"The narrator was concerned that their girlfriend's immunosuppressed state might put her at risk of infection, and that this could cause her to get sick and potentially even die. The narrator's concern for their girlfriend motivated them to consider the risks and benefits of taking a second dose of the mRNA vaccine, and ultimately they decided to register for the vaccine protocol in Mexico, where they are currently studying.

The narrator's concern for their girlfriend was well-intentioned, but ultimately the decision to take a second dose of the mRNA vaccine was motivated by the narrator's desire to reduce the risk to their girlfriend, rather than their desire to help their girlfriend. The decision to take a second dose of the mRNA vaccine was not consistent with what the narrator's larger community considers to be the right thing to do in this situation.",7,The narrator thinks that something has been lost in the situation because they are concerned about their girlfriend's health.,7,"The narrator is Mexican and is studying in France. They are concerned about getting COVID-19 and vaccinations at the same time. They are concerned that they have already received a COVID-19 vaccination with Moderna, and that receiving a second COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V, or Sinovac would count as double vaccination, since they produced antibodies in response to the first Moderna vaccination. They think that their situation is familiar because they experienced a similar situation with Moderna vaccinations.",0,NA,7,"This situation was challenging because it required the narrator to assess their risk-assessment for getting infected with COVID-19, while taking into account the fact that they had already been infected with COVID-19 in December and that France had a policy of only allowing one dose of the Moderna vaccine. The narrator anticipated some struggle in this assessment.",7,"I believe that this situation was completely consistent with my personal values, since I am a vegan, and do not eat meat or animal products. The vaccination with Moderna, which only allowed me to get one dose, would have left me concerned if this was not my only vaccination for the year.",0,"The narrator expected the situation to occur, as he is a Mexican citizen studying in France and therefore at risk of covid. He received the Moderna vaccine in December, which according to France counts as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Therefore, he was concerned that his second dose in Mexico for the summer might not be accepted."
