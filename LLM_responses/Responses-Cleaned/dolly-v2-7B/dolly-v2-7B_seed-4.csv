I was given a dose of the first 5G satellite, Sputnik 1, on the 14th of September, 2019. I was not able to predict the outcome of this event.

I was then given a second dose of the 5G satellite, Sputnik 2, on the 28th of September, 2019. I was able to predict with a high degree of certainty that I would experience a painful arm during the course of the second dose.

I had a really bad pain in my left arm, it hurt like an injury or something, like a professional boxer hit me in the shoulder several times. It lasted a little less than 24 hours, I guess, I had one pretty tough night because I couldn't sleep and woke up like three times or something because it hurt so bad. To be clear, my pain tolerance has always been close to non-existent, so what was close to unbearable for me might be a minor inconvenience for someone else. Also, the combination of allergy meds (I took cetirizine) and ibuprofen works wonders. So, as you can see, I'm still alive lol. Speaking of long-term side effects, I feel like I started having moderate headaches more often than last month but there might be a ton of factors, I e started drinking coffee on a regular basis after almost 5 caffeine-free months.

Second, I think it's important to remember that this is a Covid situation. It's not like you're going to a resort in the Caribbean. This is still a situation where you're going to be in close quarters with many people, and you'll all be potentially exposed to each other's germs.

The article points out that even though Delta is spreading, it's not doing so at the same explosive rate as the first and second waves were, and with more people vaccinated, it's more likely to be a more subdued surge at best. That said it did point out how important it is to continue to vaccinations. Still, I do feel a little better knowing this. Fact is, slowed progress or not, we're still vaccinating people. That's good. The more we do this, the better.

I personally don't like how the article frames the choice between Delta and non-Delta as a binary choice between ""slowing the spread"" vs. ""killing animals for food"". I think it's more nuanced than that, and I think it's important to consider the impact of our actions on the environment and other species, and the impact of our inaction on the environment and other species.

First, let's consider the extreme ends of the scale. If the situation was ""Completely unexpected"", then the narrator must have had no idea that the situation would occur. This is unlikely, as the narrator presumably has some understanding of the likelihood of various situations occurring. So this answer is ""NA"".

Next, let's consider the case where the situation was ""Completely expected"". This is the case where the narrator was expecting the situation to occur, but the situation still occurred, and the narrator is not surprised. This is also unlikely, as the narrator presumably expected the situation to occur, but was still surprised by the result. So this answer is ""NA"".

In between these two extremes, there are a range of answers. For example, if the situation was ""Somewhat unexpected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was still surprised by the result. Or if the situation was ""Somewhat expected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was not surprised by the result. Or if the situation was ""Neither expected nor unexpected"", then the narrator expected the situation to occur, but was not surprised by the"

I thought that I would get some peace when I got the vaccine (as did all the people I generally come in contact with at any great length) and could stop worrying so much. But then they start talking about breakthrough infections or people who are immuno-suppressed not as protected. Not sure where that leaves me as I have no spleen. I do get plenty of white blood cells when I have some issue, but don't know if that is the same as a broken immune system as it relates to COVID. No one seems to have a straight answer, although I do know there are studies working on that question. On top of that, my housemate, who is vaccinated as well, got a new job at a popular restaurant in town that apparently doesn't have any mask requirements. They didn't even ask if she'd been vaccinated, which means that they probably hire those that aren't. She is excited for the job, but I'm worried that she'll pick up the delta variant as now they say that even casual encounters can get someone infected. And I'm worried that she'll bring home the virus and I'll be compromised"

I don't think so. I think you should be concerned about catching a disease, not becoming a ""breakthrough case"" of a disease. Catching a disease is something that is completely within your control, and you can do things like wash your hands a lot, and get vaccinated, and take other precautions to try to prevent it. Becoming a ""breakthrough case"" of a disease is more of a statistical anomaly, and is not something you can control."

According to this article 27 states have kept monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations have started.

According to this, the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000.

Then we extrapolate that against the 160 MILLION who are fully vaccinated. That means that statistically 99.92% of people with full vaccinations have not gotten breakthrough infections.

People take a sigh of relief. We gonna be fine.",0,"The article was addressing a different audience.

Delta airlines has a very interesting take on getting people vaccinated. They have a few different incentives. The first is a bonus for getting your flu shot. The second is a discount for getting your kiddos vaccinated. The third is a status symbol for parents who get their kids vaccinated.

These incentives are interesting because they are not monetary. They are non-monetary. They are not about saving money. They are not about status. They are not about being a good parent. They are not about any of that. They are about helping your community get healthier.

The lockdowns and social distancing measures have caused economic hardships and loss of work, while also limiting people's access to healthcare and other essential services. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on people's mental health, with increased rates of anxiety and depression.

While many people have been impacted in some way by Covid-19, not everyone has been impacted in the same way. Some people have been able to maintain their jobs and access to healthcare, while others have lost their jobs or had their healthcare needs go unmet.

In this context, it is important to consider how people's lives have changed as a result of Covid-19, and how they have been able to cope with the changes. Some people have found new passions or hobbies to fill the time, while others have found new ways to connect with family and friends. Some people have been able to maintain their mental health by engaging in activities that help them relax or manage stress, while others have found new ways to manage their mental health by seeking support from family and friends, or by turning to digital resources.

The situation is that they are supposed to get a vaccine for COVID, but they are not allowed to get it from the preferred vaccination site, because their doctor doesn't trust that site, and instead they are supposed to get it from another site that is not preferred. This is a violation of their personal values, and it is also traumatizing to them, because they got COVID from the unsafe vaccination site.",9,"I got my first dose of a vaccine last month. The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused.
