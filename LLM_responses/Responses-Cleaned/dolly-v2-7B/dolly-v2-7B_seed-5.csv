I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk. However, Im also afraid that the vaccine will cause further autoimmune problems, as the disease I already have is already a lot to deal with especially when I cant find a health professional that knows enough about it to help me. Im hoping someone here might be able to drop some knowledge?

For example, a situation may be perceived as challenging if the individual does not have the required knowledge or skills to handle the situation.

From what I gather, the narrator is experiencing nausea and vertigo as a result of taking a painkiller for another condition.

The narrator is also taking the Moderna vaccine, which is a new, experimental vaccine that is believed to cause side effects similar to the painkiller.
From this description, it sounds like the painkiller is causing the nausea and vertigo, and the Moderna vaccine is causing the narrator to experience more severe symptoms.
From what I gather, the situation is not completely fair.

The situation involved being inside with a large group of people (100-150 people), and the narrator was concerned about being exposed to unvaccinated people and people not wearing masks.

The narrator also thought that the situation was extremely anxiety-provoking, and they were concerned about being inside with a large group of people.",0,I'm not sure if I can attend because of my health anxiety.

However, the narrator does not mention that they are concerned about the number of people who eat meat, which is a value that the narrator holds.

I also got the J&J vaccine, and its effectiveness against delta seems somewhat unclear.

I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations",0,I don't know how to answer this question.

I think the best course of action is to buy a non-valved mask and wear it in public places where there is a high likelihood of people (e.g. grocery stores, pharmacies, doctor's offices, etc.) If you're concerned about getting infected, it's better to wear a non-valved mask in these places than to put your mother at risk by wearing a valved mask in a public place.",7,"The narrator is a vegan and believes in not killing for food.

I'm a bit confused by your question as well. I don't know if you're still in quarantine or if you've been released to go back to your normal life. But I'll try to provide some insight.
First, I think it's important to note that the CDC has updated their guidance on who should get a Covid vaccine. The original guidance recommended that only people who had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 should get the vaccine. The new guidance recommends that people who have had close contact with a person who has a confirmed case of COVID-19, but who do not have symptoms, should also get the vaccine. The rationale is that the vaccine will provide some level of immunity even if the person does not develop symptoms.
Second, I think it's important to note that the vaccine is not 100% effective. The CDC reports that the effectiveness of the vaccine is between 40% and 85% for people who have received two doses. So, even if you received two doses of the vaccine, you may still get COVID-19 even if you do not develop symptoms.
Third, I think it's important to note that there are still many unknown",0,"I don't know. I mean, I guess it depends on how the vaccines perform against this new variant.

- The narrator's knowledge of the situation - if the narrator only has superficial knowledge of the situation, their personal values may not be well aligned with the narrator.

I expect that news sources may be reporting conflicting statistics because the statistics are not from the same source. The Ohio department of health is a government agency, whereas other news sources may be reporting statistics from a non-government organization.

The conflicting statistics may also be due to a lack of understanding of how to report statistics. For example, 45% of people in Ohio are fully vaccinated may be reported as 45% of Ohioans are fully vaccinated, whereas 45% of people in Ohio are vaccinated may be reported as 55% of Ohioans are vaccinated."

The inflammation can cause the heart to work harder, which can cause damage over time. The damage can cause the heart to work less efficiently, which can cause more inflammation. It's a vicious cycle.

The vaccine doesn't cause heart inflammation, but it can increase the risk of it happening.

Should I honestly be that concerned about becoming a breakthrough case?

I don't think so. I think you should be concerned about catching a disease, but not becoming a ""breakthrough case"". A ""breakthrough case"" is a term used by the media to refer to someone who got very sick from the vaccine, but a ""normal"" number of people who got the vaccine did not become very sick."

ooxff1,4,"I'm not sure if I'm in the right place to answer this question. I'm not an expert in vaccinations or Delta hotspots. But I'll try my best. 
First, I think it's important to note that the situation the narrator is describing is not his/her responsibility. It's the responsibility of the person who invited him/her to the party. 
Second, I think it's important to distinguish between a personal and a professional relationship. The narrator is a friend of the family, and he/she should support them in whatever decision they make. But he/she should not try to influence the decision. That's the role of a professional, which the narrator is in this case. 
Third, I think it's important to distinguish between a physical distance and a time distance. The 200 miles between the narrator and the family is a physical distance. But the time distance is the one the narrator should focus on. He/she should not try to influence the family by sending them the vaccine, because that's not what they want to hear. He/she should send the vaccine if the family asks for it. But he/she should not try to convince them to get vaccinated.

Second, if you can, find a way to get your niece or nephew vaccinated. It's not worth risking your own health to support someone else's child.

However, I think the argument is flawed because it doesn't take into account the role of variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4.

opqyul,7,"I think the narrator is concerned about their children not having any protection against COVID-19, and worries about their husband traveling alone to attend the funeral of his grandmother, who passed away in another province. The narrator also mentions that their children are under the age of 12, which means they are not vaccinated for certain diseases. The narrator also mentions that they are both vaccinated for COVID-19, but their children are not.
I don't know if the narrator is correct to be concerned about their children not being vaccinated, and not being able to prevent their children from being infected with COVID-19. However, I don't know if the narrator has considered other factors that could contribute to their children being unvaccinated, or not being able to receive the vaccine. For example, the narrator mentions that their children are under the age of 12, and that their children are not vaccinated for certain diseases. The diseases that children under the age of 12 are not vaccinated for include polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox. It is also possible that the children are not vaccinated for COVID-19 because the children's doctor did not recommend the vaccination for COVID-19. It is also possible that the children's insurance does not cover the vaccination for COVID-",7,"I think other people are responsible for causing the situation because:

I would recommend waiting until the whole family is vaccinated before your husband travels.  It sounds like you are already following all the social distancing recommendations, so your husband should be able to keep himself safe, but if he doesn't have the vaccine, he is at risk of getting the virus and bringing it home to your family.  That is a really big risk, and one that you don't want to take.  You can't make him stay home, and you can't make him not travel, so you are left with a really tough choice.  He can either wait until your family is vaccinated, or he can go without you, but he can't do both.  If he waits, he can still catch the virus and bring it home to your family, but he will have some protection from the vaccine.  If he goes without you, he will be completely unprotected and at risk of getting the virus and bringing it home to your family.

However, this raises a number of questions. 

First, how exactly do you administer a vaccine? You can't just go to a doctor's office and get a shot, you need to be seen in a medical setting. This means that you need to either lie about getting the vaccine from a doctor, or find a doctor who will administer the vaccine without verifying your insurance status.

Second, what if you can't get the vaccine? What if you live in a location where there is no provider for the vaccine? Or what if you don't have insurance? In this case, you'll either have to find a way to pay out of pocket, or lie to your doctor about your insurance status.

Finally, what if you don't want to get the J&J vaccine? What if you don't want to get any vaccines? In this case, you'll either have to find a way to get around the requirement to get the J&J vaccine, or lie to your doctor.

The vaccination site was very unsafe and I ended up getting infected from there. Having COVID has honestly traumatised me and it's made me very confused on what to do. The irony is not lost on me though that I got it from the vaccination site. I was due to have my 2nd dose a couple of weeks ago, however, I missed it because I was still recovering from lingering symptoms. Now that I'm feeling better, I was supposed to go get it but one of my doctors told me to defer it. Honestly, he doesn't seem to trust the brand I got and suggested I wait for the availability of another (which is my preferred brand). To be completely honest, I would wait for my preferred brand but I'm also terrified of the Delta variant that's expected to surge where I live. But I'm also terrified of going back to the vaccination site (it's very PTSD for me). I feel trapped and I feel like whatever decision I make, something bad will happen. I'm so confused.
