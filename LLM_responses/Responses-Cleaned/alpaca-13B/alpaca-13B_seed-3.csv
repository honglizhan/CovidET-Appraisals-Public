It seems like a lot of people are trying to find a way to justify their own actions by saying that they have ""free will"" and that it's their choice to do whatever they want. But I'm not sure if this is really true. I mean, if someone is starving and they have the choice to either eat or not eat, it's their choice, but it doesn't mean that they have the free will to choose whatever they want. I mean, if someone is starving, they don't really have the free will to choose to eat or not eat, since they don't have the resources to do so. So, I'm not sure if this is really the right place to ask this, but I'm just curious to know why people are so obsessed with the idea of free will.
