As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.",dim15,5,"The narrator believes that the situation is neutral, as it is not consistent with their wants, needs, or goals.",alpaca-7B,no,yes,2,no

My side effects are mild compared to what Covid long-haulers go through. I don't regret getting that first shot at all. I decided not to get the second shot with my doctor's support, because I've been so unwell that they say my body needs a break. I was hospitalized for a rapid heartbeat and chest pain 2 weeks ago which I was told is pleurisy. The pain has only gotten worse, but the doctor told me that it will eventually go away. I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it. These physical and mental effects are just making me feel pretty bummed out and sad. I know that I'm lucky to not have it as bad as many other people during these Covid times. But I feel really alone in this, as everyone around me is getting vaccinated and going out and enjoying life, right as I'm getting so sick and homebound. I have faith that this will get better, I'm just having a hard time accepting that I need to put my life on hold until it does. Support, kind words, anything, much appreciated. And to add again - please get vaccinated! My experience is very rare and everyone I know had minimal side effects, if any. That's part of what's making me feel so alone in this!",dim21,9,"The situation is taking an extreme toll on the narrator's physical health, as well as beginning to affect their mental health.

I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms ""long Covid"" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some ""vaccine vanguard"" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time ""reactivated"" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation.

I was waiting for this so long, and now I'm just... mildly disappointed. right now situation in my country is more or less okay, but I am still WFH, and my office sent us official info that we can start coming back to the office only since September. so I'm still gonna be stuck at home over the summer. then also I am worried that September return to the office won't happen because everyone is scaring is that we will have another wave in the autumn. so literally what is the point? the only consolation I have is that I am being responsible, and I'm not contributing to the situation potentially getting worse again.

However, the masks are a nightmare for me personally. They trigger off my migraines, I could hardly concentrate at school because of it. I also have a sensory disability, which makes wearing masks 10 times harder. Everything is brighter, louder, and everything feels more crowded when I wear them. Its horrible. And it looks like we have to wear them for the next school year, and its my final year. I cant risk it. So I want to know if any you know where I can get masks that are migraine/sensory friendly? While still doing the job a normal medical mask does. Thanks.",dim9,0,1,flan-t5-xxl,no,no,1,no
