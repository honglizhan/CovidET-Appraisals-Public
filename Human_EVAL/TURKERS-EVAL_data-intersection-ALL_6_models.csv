The Delta variant is a strain of the virus that has mutated since the vaccines were developed. The vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to build antibodies that fight off the virus, but the mutation the Delta variant has made means the immune system doesn't know how to fight it, so it needs to build new antibodies. The new antibodies don't know how to fight the Delta variant, either, so you need to go back to masking and social distancing.

The Delta variant is a strain of the virus that has mutated since the vaccines were developed.

The new antibodies don't know how to fight the Delta variant, either, so you need to go back to masking and social distancing.

Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.
